      <description>What works as of late October 2024.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(This post is an expansion of a thread originally posted to my <a href="https://writeout.ink/@ljwrites/113367150385436478">Mastodon writing account</a>)</p>
<h2 id="background-how-to-use-this-post-and-warning">Background, how to use this post, and warning</h2>
<p>Late last year I downloaded my Kobo e-books to my Arch Linux computer through the Kobo desktop app and removed DRM protections using Calibre and the Obok plugin.
See <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/the-weird-rules-governing-what-we-download">The Weird Rules Governing What We Download</a> for general background information on DRM protections and why they are anti-consumer (<strong>link changed 2025-01-17</strong>).
For my part I don&rsquo;t like the reading software and environments that Kobo&rsquo;s DRM restricted me to, and I want to own and control my purchases by being able to read and store my books freely without the risk of losing access to them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll detail the de-DRM process here to document it, and so others can follow along if they want.
Let me know at my email (lj [at] ljwrites [dot] blog) or my Mastodon account above if you have comments or questions,
I&rsquo;ll try to help you and update the post accordingly.
If you&rsquo;re on Windows or Mac and don&rsquo;t need to install the Kobo Desktop Edition through Wine, you can skip to the final section on <a href="https://ljwrites.blog/posts/kobo-drm-removal/#remove-drm-with-the-obok-plugin-on-calibre">Calibre and the Obok plugin</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING (added 2025-01-17): Stripping DRM from your content may be ILLEGAL depending on your jurisdiction.</strong>
This post comes with no warranty whatsoever that the described activity is legal where you are:
There is a possibility that you may be subject to measures such as having your account removed, or to civil, criminal, and other liabilities.
You should undertake de-DRM solely at your own risk and with whatever advice you feel you need, and I can take no responsibility for the consequences.</p>
<p>That said, as a practical matter you are unlikely to be detected or pursued as long as you keep your files for your own use on devices you own and don&rsquo;t pirate the books by indiscriminately distributing them.
You should refrain from piracy in most circumstances anyway, both to reduce your exposure to legal risk and as a basic courtesy to authors who depend not only on income from sales but also on sales figures for career options and algorithmic promotion.</p>
<p>The warning above, incidentally, is exactly why individually implemented technological fixes are not a replacement for regulatory changes.
DRM needs to be destroyed or overhauled, not simply tiptoed around, and I recognize that options available to a few technically skilled individuals who are willing to brave some legal risk are a stopgap at best, for much the same reasons that <a href="https://matduggan.com/self-hosting-isnt-a-solution-its-a-patch/">Self-Hosting Isn&rsquo;t a Solution; It&rsquo;s a Patch</a>.
Tutorials like this one are workarounds for a few and obviously do not scale like solutions and improvements at a societal level.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-wine-for-a-32-bit-installation">Set up Wine for a 32-bit installation</h2>
<p>For me, setting up Wine on my 64-bit architecture for a 32-bit installation was the most time-consuming part of the process.
I&rsquo;m not even sure why I&rsquo;m supposed to trick Wine into thinking it&rsquo;s on a 32-bit architecture, but it didn&rsquo;t work until I did.</p>
<p>You can check your kernel architecture with <code>uname -a</code>.
Here&rsquo;s my output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">

</div>
</div><p>The <code>x86_64</code> part means it&rsquo;s a 64-bit architecture.

</div><p>Obok is part of DeDRM Tools, available through the <a href="https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/releases/tag/v7.2.1">Github repo</a>.
Unzip the file and <code>obok_plugin.zip</code> should be one of the files that appear in the folder.</p>
<p>As detailed in <a href="https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/blob/master/obok_plugin_ReadMe.txt">the repository&rsquo;s readme file</a>, open Calibre and navigate to Preferences &gt; Plugins and then the &ldquo;Load plugin from file&rdquo; button at the bottom of the Plugins window.
Select the <code>obok_plugin.zip</code> file from the file navigation that pops up.
Choose what menus to access Obok through, then click through the installation.</p>
<p>I then configured Obok through Preferences &gt; Plugins &gt; Obok to manually set the Kobo Desktop Edition library folder that Obok should access.
In my case the directory was <code>~/.wine32/drive_c/users/lj/AppData/Local/Kobo/Kobo Desktop Edition</code>.
I think the folder is automatically detected on Windows and Mac.
Maybe there&rsquo;s auto-detect on Linux systems, too, but it didn&rsquo;t happen for me.</p>
<p>Click on the Obok icon, which in my case is on the top menu bar of Calibre, and a popup window will show decrypted versions of books downloaded through Kobo Desktop Edition.
All that remains is to import them into the Calibre library as DRM-free epubs that you can read on any device and software that supports the format.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-postscript">Conclusion and postscript</h2>
<p>Since removing DRM restrictions on my Kobo library I&rsquo;ve been reading my epubs on everything from the Emacs nov-mode package on desktop to Foliate on Steam Deck&rsquo;s desktop mode (a.k.a. my second Arch machine).
It&rsquo;s made reading ebooks more fun and I&rsquo;ve been reading more as a result.
My decrypted books are also in local and remote locations through my usual backups, so I know I won&rsquo;t lose access to them by some whim of the bookshop or publisher.</p>
<p>I hope DRM removal will be a similarly positive experience for others, especially those like me with large Kobo libraries.</p>

      <title>Why I wrote fanfic and why I stopped</title>
      <link>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/fanfic-writing-history/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate>

      <description>Fanfic filled me up as a writer until it limited me.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="fanfic-a-memory-the-beginning-first-shot-fired">Fanfic, a Memory: The Beginning: First Shot Fired</h2>
<p>I shared a piece of creative writing on the internet for the first time while my parents&rsquo; home was being renovated and I needed a place other than the motel to kill a few hours during the day.
At my request, Mom dropped me off at what we call a PC room but is probably  recognizable to more English speakers as an &ldquo;internet café.&rdquo;
In Korea it was and is primarily a place where people can get on high-spec computers to play online games.
Starcraft was the leading obsession at the time.</p>
<p>This was in 2001, three years since I had first gone online on the wide Web as a college freshman.
I had been reading a lot of stories on fanfiction.net, and by this point I had decided I wanted to try writing&mdash;and, more scarily, sharing&mdash;my own.
Either I copied-and-pasted a chapter I had pre-written, or pecked out my first chapter right then and there while my neighbors inhaled cup noodles and battled (as) Zergs.</p>
<p>I published my chapter.
It was the start of a decades-long preoccupation.</p>
<h2 id="when-fanfic-was-good-it-was-very-very-good">When fanfic was good, it was very, very good</h2>
<p>Since that day in 2001 I wrote fanfic on and off for around 20 years, through years studying abroad and overseas moves, marriage, career changes and more.
The habit persisted across several different fandoms including <em>Final Fantasy VIII,</em> <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender,</em> and <em>Star Wars.</em>
Fanfic was my first opportunity to show my writing in public, talk to other writers, and join in fandom discussions and analysis.</p>
<p>The built-in community of a good-sized fandom was a great platform for me to share my stories, get feedback on them, and join in world and character discussions.
As a beginning author, or even realistically as part of many &ldquo;real&rdquo; writing careers, I was unlikely to get hundreds of comments over the years, get sent fan art of scenes from my stories, or be translated into Japanese and Spanish.
In that sense I&rsquo;d call my fanfic writing years a creative career of itself, right down to making no money from it but getting plenty of fulfillment.</p>
<p>A highly flattering comment that stuck in my memory from my early fandom days was &ldquo;What are you doing writing FAN fiction?&rdquo;
Well, I was getting comments and reactions like these, to my great joy! :D</p>
<p>Fandom peaked for me with <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> in the early 2010s.
This was the period when I wrote <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6821006/1/Shadow-of-the-Dragon-King">Shadow of the Dragon King</a>, a political pre-show fic that not only engaged deeply with the show&rsquo;s lore and my love for it, but also showed me what directions I wanted to take my creative writing.
For me it provided some of the best experiences fanfic can provide, with existing characters, lore, and world providing structure and inspiration to build on.
I got great reactions and intense conversations out of this fic, exactly the kind of thing I wanted as a writer.</p>
<p>Things were very, very good.
They were ready to turn horrid.</p>
<h2 id="then-fandom-went-from-limiting-to-excruciating">Then fandom went from limiting to excruciating</h2>
<p>Even while I was having the most fun I had ever had in fandom, cracks were appearing in my relationship with it.
Some of these were small and harmless mismatches, like realizing that some of my English-speaking audience understood ATLA canon differently than I did,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> so much so that some readers thought my painstakingly canon-compliant fics were AU.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
That was perfectly fine: I don&rsquo;t own anyone&rsquo;s understanding of any work, including my own.
The author is dead, long live the author, etc.</p>
<p>However, for the first time fanfic started feeling like less of a boost and more of a constriction.
The old joking question&mdash;what I was doing writing fan fiction?&mdash;started taking on more weight.
More and more I hankered to play in a world of my own creation or interpretation, exploring stories that pulled at me.
Now that the experience with <em>Shadow</em> had given me confidence that I could finish a long fic, I wanted to try my hand at the wild wide world of original fiction, so-called.</p>
<p>Other fandom discordances were more serious.
My severe disappointment with the ATLA sequel <em>Legend of Korra</em> was another and deeper crack that not only distanced me from the franchise but led me to question my love of the original show.
As I put it in an early &rsquo;10s book review, my political and literary views had become inextricable from each other.
I was increasingly facing down the fact that I could not rely on corporate media to tell the kinds of stories I wanted.</p>
<p>Looking back, Disney&rsquo;s new <em>Star Wars</em> was my last stab at making fandom work out for me.
There were definitely good times, lovely camaraderie and intense nerdiness, but the unending sludge of antiblack racism against the character Finn and his Black fans brought home just how sickeningly white supremacist fandom could be, and had always been as incidents like Racefail &lsquo;09 demonstrated.
I just hadn&rsquo;t smacked into this face of fandom quite so hard before because the franchises I was into didn&rsquo;t have major Black characters (which is a whole conversation of its own).</p>
<p>After these experiences I couldn&rsquo;t enjoy <em>Star Wars</em> or even my earlier fandoms the same way anymore.
Between major life changes and the work of developing my original fiction ideas, I didn&rsquo;t want to spend that kind of energy on a space I no longer found enjoyable.
From around 2020 my fandom activities including fanfic became sporadic and I have not engaged in fandom with the same intensity since.</p>
<h2 id="so-i-left-dot-dot-dot-or-did-i">So I left&hellip; or did I?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because while I&rsquo;m mostly out of mainstream fandom now, I&rsquo;m still as fannish as ever and more happily so than I ever was.
I simply shifted the lens of my obsessions from a focus on for-profit corporate media to smaller, queerer, more liberationist works, often created by friends I trust and regularly talk to.
My emotional well-being and creative energy have skyrocketed since I started engaging in works that are more aligned to me, while spending my time on gentle, compassionate, and <em>fun</em> conversations based on a mutual love of stories and not reactions to repetitive bigotry that wore me down.</p>
<p>The best parts of writing fanfic have followed me out of fandom.
I pursue the exact kinds of stories I want in the world while taking part in welcoming yet endlessly stimulating creative communities.
My &ldquo;original,&rdquo; or saleable, subject matter puts me in conversation with what has been and is being created in queer history and mythology, anti-capitalism and anti-colonialism,  labor solidarity and more.
I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to have my queer and critical works in prose and verse <a href="https://ljwrites.blog/about/#publications">accepted by publications</a> I enjoy and respect, and found more community in fantastic editors and fellow authors.</p>
<p>In a way I&rsquo;ve lost fanfic and fandom, but in another sense I haven&rsquo;t lost them at all.
I simply moved on and found people and spaces that better fit the shapes I&rsquo;ve come to take, that allow me to stretch out in ways that make sense to me.</p>
<p>I needed to write and share fanfic that day in 2001 and for many, many days afterward while my world and self shifted around.
When those changes came to a head, I needed to stop writing fanfic and being part of fandom so I could work on other things and be parts of other conversations.</p>
<p>Fanfic and fandom in the formal senses are mostly in my past now, but the ongoing give-and-take of creation, the shaping of worlds and meaning in joyous collision with minds near and far, will never stop as long as I live and will long outlast my individual life.
I am deeply content with where I have drifted to and looking forward to what comes next.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>(2024-10-26 update) I was asked on fedi what these differences were. There were two big ones, the first being my belief that there was sexism in the Fire Nation, with women firebenders restricted from combat roles, Uncle Iroh being a bit paternalistically and reflexively sexist, and my headcanon that Azula was soft-crossdressing to be taken more seriously. The second major difference in opinion was that Zuko was always anti-war both pre- and post-exile, but despised the Avatar for&ndash;he thought&ndash;hiding away ignoring the war and the suffering it caused. Zuko&rsquo;s understandable confusion on first meeting Aang that the Avatar was a preteen boy and not a centagenarian would be the beginning of a long evolution of his views and his ultimate conviction that his father needed to be taken down. I&rsquo;m gratified to report that the folks I spoke to on fedi shared my interpretations or at least didn&rsquo;t feel them to be unreasonable, so I know now it wasn&rsquo;t just me and I wasn&rsquo;t totally off-base!&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <description>My review of The Lantern and the Night Moths for Exchanges, a journal of literary translation.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was delighted to work with <a href="https://exchanges.uiowa.edu/">Exchanges</a>, the University of Iowa&rsquo;s literary translation journal, to publish a long-form review of The Lantern and the Night Moths (Invisible Publishing, 2024), Yilin Wang&rsquo;s collection of translated modern Chinese poetry and essays.
It was an amazing experience to publish with a journal I admire for an author and work I&rsquo;m excited about, and my awesome editor helped me push the review far beyond my original vision to an even better place of engagement with and information on the book.</p>

<p><em>The Lantern and the Night Moths</em></p>
<p>Edited and Translated by Yilin Wang</p>
<p>Invisible Publishing, 120 pp., $16.95 (paper)</p>
<p>Review by L.J. Lee</p>
<div class="verse">
<p><em>The world&rsquo;s ten thousand beings are all ephemeral,</em><br />
    <em>but through being perceived they&rsquo;ll become born anew</em><br />
<br />
<em>Everything has changed and shall keep on changing,</em><br />
    <em>but through books the fleeting will be preserved for eternity</em><br />
<br />
– Excerpt from “Tiānyī Gé, the First Library Under the Sky” by Zhang Qiaohui, translated by Yilin Wang<br /></p>
</div>
<p>The preservation of the ephemeral and easily-forgotten is an explicit goal of <em>The Lantern and the Night Moths</em> (Invisible Publishing, 2024), a selection of poetry by five modern and contemporary Chinese poets translated by Chinese-Canadian writer and translator Yilin Wang.
The collection, accompanied by Wang’s original essays and notes, spans the first glimmers of the 20th century to the present.
It passes through the turmoil of China&rsquo;s Republic years, the exciting anxieties of the New Culture movement, and the imagery, dilemmas, and yearnings of 21st-century life.</p>
<p>Yet <em>Night Moths</em> takes a branch off the most-travelled paths across the vast landscape of modern Chinese poetry, offering a different scenery.
In making the selections, Wang deliberately avoided the most famous and translated modernist poets, stating “I also step around the latest, bestselling, and most renowned Sinophone literary works to seek out poetry that has been overlooked.”
Also, “By experimenting with recreating [the] work [of underrepresented poets] in English, I hope to expand existing understandings of Sinophone poetry in the Anglosphere.”</p>
<p>These are ambitious goals for a first collection, and the result of Wang’s design principle is a work that is less familiar, more female, and more eclectic than a conventional collection covering the same eras.
You will find no poems in these pages by mainstays like Xu Zhimo, Bei Dao, or Ai Qing.
The emerging and acclaimed women poets Zhang Qiaohui and Xiao Xi are published for the first time in English translation, and the anti-Qing Dynasty rebel Qiu Jin receives focus as a poet in addition to the historical figure she is conventionally known as.
Wang&rsquo;s self-assurance as a curator and translator of poetry is on full display, as is a confidence that this different view of Chinese modern and contemporary poetry is more than worth experiencing—and remembering.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the poet-translator does not simply leave readers unmoored in waters that may be unfamiliar even to the well-versed.
Wang ably guides the reader, not only intellectually but also emotionally, in essays and commentary included at the end of each poet’s section.
The varied approaches of these notes add further levels of understanding and reading pleasure:
the commentary on Qiu Jin’s poetry is an intimate epistolary essay addressed to the poet, who is Wang’s personal hero as well as scholarly and literary subject;
the short notes for each of Zhang Qiaohui’s poems explore diasporic yearnings and the fleeting nature of memory in a format that loses nothing for its brevity.
Fei Ming, meanwhile, is treated to an intensely researched intellectual and spiritual history, entwined with process notes for the difficult task of translating his infamously enigmatic work.
Poem-by-poem notes on Xiao Xi go over the challenges of translation in the context of contemporary history and references.
The final essay on the eminent early 20th-century poet and translator Dai Wangshu doubles as a partial biography that draws from his times to better understand our own.</p>
<p>There is a sense of urgency in this project of remembrance and celebration, as so much writing is forgotten and lost in the interplay between memory and oblivion.
In an anecdote shared in the translator’s note to “Soliloquy” by Zhang Qiaohui, Wang’s wàipó (maternal grandmother) was drafting a memoir which she promised to show her grandchild the next time they met.
After wàipó&rsquo;s death, however, Wang searched for the manuscript in vain.
What happened to it, and what story might it have told?
The answer is locked in shadows, much like the matrilineal history such a manuscript may have revealed to a grieving grandchild.
A driving force in <em>The Lantern and the Night Moths</em> is episodes like these:
the reality that women&rsquo;s voices and stories are disproportionately forgotten, lost, and erased.</p>
<p>If perception is the great resistance to oblivion, books may be the preservation of perception into a hope of eternity.
These books may find their way to someone&rsquo;s bedside and become a repository of their happiness, as Dai Wangshu said of his own books.
They may also be lovingly collected by eclectic routes ranging from ethnic grocery stores to the luggage bags of friends, like Wang’s own hard-won collection of Chinese-language books.
Books, after all, are a communion with their writers, and with the people who helped put the books in the reader’s hands, from booksellers to generous friends.
“the lantern light seems to have written a poem; / they feel lonesome since i won&rsquo;t read them,” Fei Ming writes in “lantern.”
To be unread is loneliness, a fading out from the shared memory of community.</p>
<p>A translated book, then, is the ultimate defiance against ephemerality, not only preserving the existence of a work but also expanding its reach to other lands and other peoples across the distance of language and context.
Surprising things emerge when this crossing is made:
In the translation of Dai Wangshu’s poem “Night Moths,” for instance, the poet’s shadow has been “abandoned . . . in grave darkness.”
Two lines down, the poem ends with “that day I transformed into a phoenix,” juxtaposing “grave darkness” with the common Western image of a phoenix coming back to life from the ashes.</p>
<p>Yet those familiar with the cultural conventions involved may realize that the original Chinese word fēng 凤 , meaning the male of mythical noble birds, does not traditionally have the connotation of periodic death and rebirth despite commonly being translated into English as “phoenix.”
Wang’s translation, refracting language and mythical reference through layers of subtly unmatched imagery and double meaning, lends the poem a new reading in English while staying true to the Chinese original by foregrounding the association of yōuàn 幽暗 (deep darkness) with the underground and graves.
One suspects Dai would have approved, as a culture-spanning poet-translator himself who wedded Zhuangzi to Descartes in the verse “I think, therefore I am a butterfly…” in the poem “I Think.”</p>
<p>At other times things are dropped in the crossing, echoing in the crevice between worlds.
A reader of both languages might mourn the loss of Qiu Jin&rsquo;s pun and rhyme in “A River of Crimson: A Brief Stay in the Glorious Capital,” where under Wang&rsquo;s hand, the lines</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>身不得, 男儿列; Shēnbùdé, nán’érliè;<br />
心却比, 男儿烈! Xīnquèbǐ, nán’érliè!<br /></p>
</div>
<p>became the following:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>Not a man in the flesh,<br />
    unable to walk amongst them;<br />
but the heart exceeds,<br />
    more fierce than a man&rsquo;s!<br /></p>
</div>
<p>There was also the choice, freely acknowledged in the translation notes, to abandon the repetition of zhùyì 注意 in Xiao Xi&rsquo;s “the car is backing up, please pay attention,” in favor of using different wording for the many nuances of the word: “be mindful of,” “watch out for,” “take note of” and more.
Those who love the cadence and wordplay of the originals may object, but we who have taken the leap between languages know there is no such thing as having it all.</p>
<p>Knowing these limitations all too well, Wang calls the poetic translation process “cultivating the inexpressible,” where “every iteration bears testimony to that which has been lost, and even more importantly, all that courageously endures.”
Yet Wang rejects the facile narrative that poetry is “untranslatable,” citing Dai Wangshu&rsquo;s 1944 essay Brief Fragments on Poetic Theory that a poem, so long as it goes beyond superficial wordplay, should always be translatable into other languages.
Wang calls the power of literary translation &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; and demonstrates it in projects such as <a href="https://metatron.press/glyphoria/translating-language-and-sound/vivian-li-yilin-wang-five-ways-of-translating-li-qingzhaos-poem/">five different translations</a> of Song dynasty poet Li Qingzhao&rsquo;s poem, undertaken with Vivian (Xiao Wen) Li.</p>
<p>If remembrance is key to continued life in a community of memory, what does it mean when translated poetry is indeed recorded and perceived but the translator is unnamed, as though there never was one?
How fleeting, ephemeral, and forgotten is the translator of poetry whose carried-over words ring in the center of Empire like a disembodied echo!
Of course, the translator was and is not lost to inevitable, self-effacing invisibility, but rather actively erased, as the British Museum did in its uncredited, unauthorized use of Wang’s Qiu Jin translations—a disregard <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/yilin-wang-translator-british-museum-settlement-intl-hnk/index.html">it only corrected</a> after a much-publicized legal campaign.
This story recurs around the globe, backed by the dismissal of translation as easy and easily-replaced work that is nevertheless somehow good enough to be used. The exploitation is sometimes framed as a favor to the translator conferring prestige and visibility, as the British Museum&rsquo;s early correspondence with Wang implied.
Subtler forms of consent violations and disrespect abound every day, such as publishing translations without <a href="https://yilinwang.com/where-the-leaves-fall/">proper contracts</a>.</p>
<p>All this buildup is now set to spike to a crescendo of exploitation and erasure as never before, with the product of untold of hours of translators’ labor scraped into large language models that prognosticators smugly promise will make us obsolete.
Though the form may be new, the foundations of the rhetoric that translators are superfluous and outdated have been laid over decades:
Even Dai Wangshu, living in a period when literary translation was highly regarded and prized by writers and scholars, criticized the publishing industry’s devaluation of poetry translations in his day, matching Wang&rsquo;s observation of today’s mainstream Anglophone and Sinophone publishing spaces.</p>
<p>Yet, as Wang points out, “many poet-translators continue to work from the margins, as persistent as ever.”
The voices of these poets who lived through China&rsquo;s modernity from the beginning to the present moment, given life for an Anglophone audience by Wang&rsquo;s careful work and keen commentary, are not only a collection of poetry translations and essays, but a lively and continuing conversation.
<em>The Lantern and the Night Moths</em> speaks not only to fellow travellers straddling the two disciplines of poetry and translation regularly declared worthless, unnecessary, and obsolete, but also to a global community who bear the scars and triumphs of this construct called modernity, and to workforces around the world increasingly consigned to the shadows of corporate and technical glitz.
In this time, the words that Wang imagines Dai Wangshu speaking across the expanse of time resonate above all:
“Don&rsquo;t worry, poetry isn&rsquo;t what is lost in translation, but rather, what survives it.”</p>

      <title>Records of homosexuality in premodern Korea</title>
      <link>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/queer-premodern-korea/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/queer-premodern-korea/</guid>
      <description>Who could their emulation of / the courtly love infringe?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is a compilation and summary of accounts from premodern Korea, defined here as largely pre-20th century, recording homosexual, gender-ambiguous/non-conforming, and otherwise queer experiences.
It will begin with a summation of premodern Korean terms on homosexuality, then discuss specific accounts of homosexuality, bisexuality, and gender nonconformity that we might today read as queer or LGBTQA, including the context of times and life history where available.
Classist bias is heavy in the historical record and many of the detailed personal contexts tend to be available for members of the ruling class such as kings, but contexts for other individual personages or classes of persons can be gleaned through the terminology used, descriptions of social customs, and the rare instances where same-gender love between working-class people, primarily of women, touched on the perceived dignity and rights of men in the ruling classes.</p>
<p>I am greatly indebted in the preparation of this write-up to Professor Kang Moon-jong&rsquo;s <em>Studies on the traditional era homosexuality</em>, published in the journal Yeongju Eomun Vol. 30 (June 2015), especially for alerting me to the existence of Yi Gyubo&rsquo;s <em>Poem Prompted by the 50 Verses Sent by Enlightened Gongong to young Master Bak</em> and some of the events and writings from the Joseon era.
The section on terminology also follows both the format of his paper and draws directly from his summation of the terms, with some modifications and additions.
Where I was unable to independently confirm a primary or secondary source cited by Professor Kang but rather rely on the paper itself, I have cited it as &ldquo;Kang (2015)&rdquo; or &ldquo;via Kang (2015).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Content warnings for this write-up include sexual violence, age gap/possible underage relationships, corporeal punishment and other violence against queer people, general political violence including murder, death from coerced labor, cisnormativity, sexism/patriarchy, etc.</p>
<h2 id="premodern-korean-terminology-on-homosexuality">Premodern Korean terminology on homosexuality</h2>
<p>The most common word for homosexuality in premodern Korea was daeshik 對食 (&ldquo;eat together&rdquo;).
Originating from the Han Dynasty of China, this referred to palace servants including maids and eunuchs entering into marriage-like committed relationships with each other.
In premodern Korea the word came to mean homosexuality in general between men and women alike, though its original meaning of love in the specific setting of court was also preserved.
A related though rarer and more limited term is gyobung 交朋 (&ldquo;making friends&rdquo;), a term that is listed to this day in the dictionary as a traditional term for female homosexuality, though it has faded from everyday use.</p>
<p>Other common terms included namchong 男寵 (&ldquo;favor of men&rdquo;) and the related one of namsaek 男色 (&ldquo;sex with men&rdquo;), which referred exclusively to male homosexuality.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Yongyang 龍陽 (&ldquo;dragon sunlight&rdquo;) was a related term referring to the title given to a king&rsquo;s favored male lover from the ancient Wei Dynasty of China, and can be seen especially in the History of Goryeo regarding favors given by kings to male lovers.</p>
<p>There are also terms relating to rape of men by men, gyegan 鷄姦 (&ldquo;chicken fornication?&rdquo;), also of Chinese origin.
Other terms relating to this crime that has seen some use in premodern Korea are bukchung 北衝 (&ldquo;northern/hind stabbing&rdquo;) and namgan 男奸 (&ldquo;male fornication&rdquo;) which seem to refer primarily to anal rape.</p>
<p>There are also the Korean terms biyeokjil 비역질 for sex between men and baendaejil 밴대질 for sex between women, but the latter is of uncertain origin and there is no existing premodern record using the term.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the leading terms for homosexuality in premodern Korean societies include daeshik (women and men), namchong (men), namsaek (men), biyeokjil (men), and in some specific circumstances, yongyang for men in court.
These terms show widespread awareness of homosexual activity in premodern Korea, with differentiation for specific social contexts.</p>

<h2 id="king-hyegong-of-shilla--8th-century--a-woman-born-in-a-man-s-body">King Hyegong of Shilla (8th century): A woman born in a man&rsquo;s body</h2>
<p>The reign of King Hyegong, the 36th king of the ancient Korean kingdom of Shilla, was marked by strife and chaos ever since taking the throne at the age of eight, with power struggles and rebellions compounded by catastrophic natural disasters.
The king was eventually slain in the political turmoil, and the end of this monarch&rsquo;s reign marks the close of the Middle Period of Shilla and the start of its Final Period.</p>
<p>It is said that King Gyeongdeok, Hyegong&rsquo;s father, badly wanted a son, having set aside his first queen for the lack of a son and wedded a second queen.
The story goes that King Gyeongdeok asked a spiritual man, Pyohun, to petition the Jade Emperor in Heaven for a royal son.
Pyohun, after meeting with the Jade Emperor, gave word from on high that there was a daughter for the king but no son.
King Gyeongdeok, persistent in his goal, asked that the daughter be exchanged for a son.
The Jade Emperor warned that it was possible, but the change would endanger the kingdom.
Gyeongdeok was unwavering, and indeed his wife gave birth to a male-assigned baby.</p>
<p>It was said that the future King Hyegong&rsquo;s unnatural birth that switched a girl into a boy caused disturbing portents, with intense thunder and lightning storms and 16 Buddhist temples being struck by lightning.
The young prince enjoyed girls&rsquo; amusements and adornments from a young age, causing people to comment on the child&rsquo;s lack of fitness as a future king.
Some say the allegations of the prince&rsquo;s birth and femininity are a commentary on King Hyegong&rsquo;s ineffectual reign.</p>
<p>King Hyegong, along with regent and mother Queen Dowager Manwol, made many attempts from early in the young king&rsquo;s reign to reinforce the failing power of the monarchy, including reforms to ancestral rites and inspecting the regions.
However, it was not enough to turn the tides of the increasing disorder from the father King Gyeongdeok&rsquo;s time.
Hyegong was said to be a soft and undisciplined king who was enamored of music and women, and was ultimately slain by high-ranking nobility at the age of 22.</p>

<h2 id="king-mokjong-of-goryeo--10th-century--the-childless-king-with-a-known-male-lover">King Mokjong of Goryeo (10th century): The childless king with a known male lover</h2>
<p>The seventh king of the medieval Korean kingdom of Goryeo and son of Gyeongjong the fifth king, Mokjong was known for his talent from a young age and for wise and beneficient policies a king, such as diplomatic efforts that promoted peace and establishment of bureaucratic and military systems for the still-new kingdom.
His reign, however, was marred by his failure to control the arbitrary abuses of power by his mother Queen Dowager Heonae.
In the end the confusion caused by the Queen Dowager&rsquo;s attempts to take power with her lover Kim Chi-yang led to a rebellion, and Mokjong was assassinated at the age of 28.</p>
<p>Mokjong had a queen and a concubine but was known to be uninterested in women and had no children, something that he expressed concern for.
He named his nephew (the son of his mother&rsquo;s late sister) First Prince Daeryang as his heir, and Prince Daeryang went on to be King Hyeonjong after him.</p>
<p>Mokjong had a lover, Yu Haeng-gan, a beautiful man who gained the king&rsquo;s favor and rose to high office on that basis in a relationship referred to as yongyang.
Yu Haeng-gan was said to be a power-hungry and arrogant man of little ability or wisdom who leaned on the king&rsquo;s favor to exercise power and prestige beyond his station and talents.
Yu Haeng-gan was opposed to Mokjong making Prince Daeryang the royal heir, so much that Mokjong made the preparations a secret from his lover.
There is speculation that Yu Chungjeong, another man that Yu Haeng-gan introduced to the king, was also a royal lover, but unlike with Yu Haeng-gan there is no direct record of a sexual relationship between Mokjong and Yu Chungjeong.
Yu Haeng-gan was also killed during the rebellion that ended Mokjong&rsquo;s reign, while there is no record of Yu Chungjeong&rsquo;s death though he was recorded as being by Mokjong&rsquo;s side when the king was expelled from the palace prior to his death.</p>

<p>Gonggong 空空 was the name taken by Great Yuga Master Gyeongjo, who was a monk in the Yuga tradition of Buddhism (originating from an order of monks who cultivated yoga practice) and rose to the rank of Threefold Great Master.
A free spirit who loved the companionship of boys, he was also known as the Poet Monk for his aptitude with verse and the King of Dharma for his deep knowledge of Buddhist doctrine.
His fame reached as far as Song in China, and he was gifted a staff, lacquered begging bowls, and prayer beads along with a poem by an esteemed monk.
He was friends with fellow literary talents of his day, and some of his religious poetry survives today.</p>
<p>The story of the love between Gonggong and a bright young man with the surname Bak is told in verse by Gonggong&rsquo;s friend Yi Gyubo, a celebrated poet and essayist in 12th and 13th century Korea.
Yi Gyubo wrote the poem, 次韻空空上人贈朴少年五十韻 (Poem Prompted by the 50 Verses Sent by Enlightened Gongong to young Master Bak), in response to verse written by Gonggong for his young lover.
The original that Yi was responding to did not survive, but this reply poem is clear enough on the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p>After an opening that discusses the yin and yang principles of the universe and the crucial role of marriage and romantic love, Yi discusses his friend Gonggong&rsquo;s indifference to women:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>孰有相逢花態度<br />

in bloom of womanhood<br />
終然得固鐵肝腸<br />
His heart shall be as hardest steel<br />
unto the bitter end.<br /></p>
</div>
<p>Instead, Yi says, Gonggong chose a simple life in spiritual retreat:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>岩扉寂寞真堪樂<br />
Though little gate is silent, this<br />
austere retreat is joy<br />
世路繁華豈所望<br />
Why at the bustle of the world<br />
wouldst spare a single glance?<br /></p>
</div>
<p>Yet one man, the young Master Bak, captures the great spiritual master&rsquo;s heart:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>未知朴子形何似<br />
I know not how this Master Bak<br />
is shaped or how he looks<br />
坐使空師意反狂<br />
To drive the meditating Gong<br />
to madness in restraint<br /></p>
</div>
<p>Yi vividly describes the feelings induced by this young man in his esteemed friend:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>自說純陽何感應<br />
To claim pure Yang as virgin male<br />
but cold a comfort lends<br />
但憐奇表最清揚<br />
The boast of purest outward mien<br />
mere pity does command.<br />
亮非走野風牛突<br />
Belike a bull that&rsquo;s penned away<br />
from field and wind will kick<br />
又豈奔泉渴鹿忙<br />
And would a thirsty stag forget<br />
toward a brook to bound?<br /></p>
</div>
<p>The emotional intimacy and longing as well as the strong desire in the relationship are made clear in the poem:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>但將款密期為友<br />
The deepest intimacy is<br />
true friendship&rsquo;s only path<br />
何忍須臾不共堂<br />
How could they merest moment&rsquo;s part-<br />
ing ever countenance?<br />
別去尋思如隔地<br />
Apart and deep in thought, &rsquo;tis like<br />
the earth were stoppered up<br />
訪來方抃況麾牆<br />
A visit met with claps, and is<br />
that waving from the fence?<br />
及當軒翥翔千里<br />
When stepping in the house he could<br />
fly all a thousand leagues<br />
得可從容宿一房<br />
All just to reach that single room<br />
and sleep in peaceful calm.<br /></p>
</div>
<p>The qualities of the young man Bak are praised in the poem as well, as a fitting match for the learned and accomplished Gonggong:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>矧此少年生早慧<br />
What&rsquo;s more, this boy despite his youth<br />
came early to be wise<br />
尤於博學飽曾嘗<br />
And breadth of learning made him in<br />
his studies a gourmand.<br />
宛如濯濯春林色<br />
His clean and shining light is like<br />
the sprouting green of spring<br />
正似團團望月光<br />
The rounded brilliance just like<br />
the full moon at a glance.<br /></p>
</div>
<p>The poem is unambiguous about the nature of the relationship, that there were not only emotional and intellectual but also sexual exchange as well.
The term daeshik, with the explicit reference to the Book of Han, leaves no question that this was a male homosexual relationship, given its usage in Korea and given that neither man was a maidservant or eunuch.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>寢底同衾情苟篤<br />
In single bedding they embrace<br />
in rest and love profound<br />
宮中對食效奚妨<br />
Who could their emulation of<br />
the courtly love infringe? [See the Book of Han]<br /></p>

<p>The 26th King of Goryeo, King Chungseon was the eldest son of King Chungryeol and Princess Supreme Jeguk, Borjigin Qutlugh Kelmysh daughter of Kubilai Khan.
Born after Goryeo&rsquo;s capitulation to the Mongol Chinese Empire of Yuan, Chungseon was the product of his father Chungryeol&rsquo;s strategic marriage to a Mongol princess to strengthen the royal family.
Chungseon himself would go on to marry a Mongol Princess, Princess Supreme Gyeguk, Borjigin Budashiri great-granddaughter of Kubilai Khan.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, King Chungseon&rsquo;s reign was never stable.
He was ousted and called to the Yuan court in favor of his father Chungryeol a mere eight months into his reign, and returned to the throne in Goryeo after Chungryeol&rsquo;s death.
This kind of instability would be a feature of Goryeo kingship during the period of Yuan interference, intensified by the ties of blood and marriage.
Only three months into his return as Goryeo&rsquo;s king he went back to the the Yuan court where he ruled from afar despite repeated requests from Goryeo to return, and would exercise heavy influence even after passing the throne onto his son King Chungsuk.
An active player in the Yuan Imperial Court, a collector of books and a promoter of scholarly exchange between Yuan and Goryeo, Chungseon was awarded princehood by Külüg Khan after helping the latter come to power, and was also exiled to Tibet in his later years during power struggles in the court before he returned and died in Yuan at the age of 50.</p>
<p>Chungseon had six queen consorts, ranging from his chief consort Princess Gyeguk, his second queen who was a Mongol woman not from the Imperial family, and four ethnic Korean queens.
He also had sexual relations with unnamed female servants, two of whom he is on record as gifting to his followers.
One of his mistresses was formerly his father Chungryeol&rsquo;s Royal Concubine Sukchang from the house of Kim.
Lady Kim was said to have been vain and extravagant, intervening in affairs of state and throwing a party during the mourning period for her own mother.</p>
<p>In addition to having many women Chungseon is described as &ldquo;greatly enjoying male love (多愛男色)&rdquo; and his favors, using the phrase the favors of yongyang (龍陽之寵), were given to Won Chung, a young man of no particular personal distinction from a high-ranking family.
Won Chung was called at age 18 by Chungseon to office greeting guests and managing the household.
At this point Chungseon was a prince-in-exile residing in Dàdū (modern-day Beijing), ousted from the Goryeo throne and in between his two reigns as King, though he was now in high favor with the Yuan court and would shortly be returning for his second reign.
Chungseon&rsquo;s favor was such that he gave Won Chung the royal surname of Wang and changed his name to Wang Ju.</p>
<p>However when Chungseon, two years into his return as King of Goryeo, tried to award Won Chung/Wang Ju even higher office, the man demurred saying he was neither experienced nor capable enough (he was not yet 20 at this time).
Angered, Chungseon took Won Chung&rsquo;s royal name away and demoted him.
The two men reconciled later on when Won Chung greeted Chungseon on his return from Yuan, coming all the way out to Goryeo&rsquo;s northern frontier of the Amnok River to meet him and treating him with care and courtesy the same as ever.
He eventually rose to the high office he had refused earlier and had the king&rsquo;s trust.</p>
<p>When Chungseon spoke to his son Chungsuk about Won Chung it was with praise, saying the man had served the royal family through generations and had ties through marriage, making him incomparable to other vassals.
Chungseon also told Won Chung to serve the king with loyalty forever.
Won Chung would go on to serve Chungseon&rsquo;s son Chungsuk and grandson Chunghye, rising to high office and going on diplomatic missions.
He was said to be restrained and diligent, taciturn, and a good administrator though he had little learning, and had three sons.</p>

         alt="A painting in tones of red and brown of a man and woman in flowing robes facing each other, the woman in a wavy headdress and the man wearing a horsehair hat."/> 
</figure>

<p>The 31st King of Goryeo, he was a grandson of King Chungseon and functionally the last recognized king of Goryeo.
It should be noted that many scholars express skepticism on the accuracy of accounts on King Gongmin; the legitimacy of his heirs, or lack thereof, had a direct impact on that of the next dynasty, Joseon, which was when the <em>History of Goryeo</em> was compiled.
Nevertheless, there is no indication that these records were manufactured out of whole cloth, though readers should certainly be aware of biases from political agendas.
The necessity for such caution arguably holds true for all historical records.</p>
<p>Gongmin is widely known and admired in Korean history for breaking Goryeo away from the Yuan Empire&rsquo;s interference as Yuan&rsquo;s power waned.
He took back territory conquered by Yuan, and ceased the use of the Mongol empire&rsquo;s calendar and customs.
Internally, he purged pro-Yuan elements in court and resettled the balance of power by weakening the political control of the military leadership and nurturing a new generation of Confucian scholar-bureaucrats.
The latter, ironically, would be some of the main forces behind the founding of Joseon which would replace Goryeo.</p>
<p>The fall of Yuan and the turmoil in the Goryeo power structure, however, caused external and internal chaos that undermined any attempts to rule.
He had to flee the palace when hundreds of thousands of Red Turban rebels who had rose up against Yuan invaded Goryeo.
He survived internal rebellions and assassination attempts, and the purges and punishments he handed down as he grew increasingly suspicious only isolated him farther.</p>
<p>The queen who supported him unconditionally throughout his anti-Yuan independence policy and internal turmoil was the Mongol Princess Supreme Noguk of Yuan, born Borjigin Budashiri.
Like every king in his line since his great-grandfather Chungryeol he wedded a Yuan Princess for political backing, but the history is very clear that King Gongmin and his wife were deeply in love&mdash;and the historians were not always approving about it.
Their love is the stuff of legend in Korean history, such as the time the Princess Supreme sat before the doors to her husband&rsquo;s room to protect him from rebel assassins, a courage praised down the ages well into the Joseon era.
There is also a charming anecdote that Gongmin, an artist who disliked horseback riding and was the only king of Goryeo who did not hunt, practiced riding with the Princess at her behest during their displacement from court.</p>
<p>The fatal flaw in their love from a patriarchal perspective was Princess Noguk&rsquo;s infertility.
This couple had no children 15 years into their marriage, which was a source of instability and concern for the dynasty.
By itself this bad luck could generally be remedied by royal polygamy, but according to the <em>History of Goryeo</em> he never much enjoyed intimacy with women and his visits to Princess Noguk were very rare.
The Princess reluctantly and sorrowfully acquiesced to the king marrying a second queen 10 years into the childless marriage, but it appears he was not intimate with the other lady at all.</p>
<p>When the Princess finally fell pregnant with the couple&rsquo;s long-awaited child, such was Gongmin&rsquo;s desire for a safe birth that he pardoned prisoners and had temples and shrines across the kingdom pray for her.
Unfortunately she died during a difficult birth, and the baby died with her.
It was a catastrophe in an already unstable reign, often seen as the beginning of the end for the king both personally and politically.</p>
<p>The loss of a strong political backing from his marriage to the Princess led Gongmin to take drastic measures to carry on his reforms, the foremost of which was appointing Shin Don, a former monk with no noble background or bureaucratic qualification, to head those reforms.
Shin Don is called both a bold reformer who put brakes on the nobility&rsquo;s abuse of power and mistreatment of the people, and an illegitimate despot who himself abused the power given to him by an increasingly unstable king.
It was Gongmin himself who eventually turned on Shin Don by arresting and executing him on charges of treachery against the throne, and the reforms ultimately failed.</p>
<p>According to the framing of the <em>History of Goryeo,</em> which as seen in the caveat above may be biased for the political agenda of justifying the next dynasty, Gongmin&rsquo;s &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; grief for his beloved queen also contributed to the fall of his kingdom.
He started wasteful construction projects for her shrine, the size of which was an enormous drain on the already embattled kingdom&rsquo;s resources.
The work itself caused the deaths of workers and suffering for the populace from the literally monumental effort to carry the materials from afar and build the edifice.
He would take meals in front of her portrait, speaking to her as though to a living wife, and his continued refusal to be intimate with his other wives meant he had no heir.
When asked by his mother eight years after the Princess&rsquo;s death why he did not frequent his queen consorts&rsquo; chambers, he replied weeping that there were none like the Princess, which his mother reprimanded as shameful and excessive grief.</p>
<p>According to the records he was not, however, adverse to intimacy with men.
The <em>History of Goryeo</em> records King Gongmin gathering young men from good families around him as his personal bodyguard, the Jajewi, on whom he bestowed numerous favors.
Some see this as analogous to the decade Gongmin himself spent as a young prince at Yuan court as an imperial bodyguard and hostage.
He also had a male lover, Kim Heung-gyeong, who received the king&rsquo;s yongyang favor and high office.
He was also placed in charge of the Jajewi.</p>
<p>The <em>History of Goryeo</em> records the Jajewi doing &ldquo;wanton and filthy&rdquo; deeds for the king&rsquo;s favor, which included sex with the king but was not described in the refined language of yongyang or even namsaek, perhaps because the sex acts with the men in question were not considered befitting a high-ranking man&rsquo;s dignity.
This allegedly consisted of the king putting on women&rsquo;s cosmetics, ordering the young men of the Jajewi to have sex with a young servant girl while he watched from the next room, and then having the men do &ldquo;wanton deeds unto him as to a woman.&rdquo;
This seems to imply being a recipient of penetration (i.e. a bottom), considered in many cultures to be shameful and submissive for a man of dominant status where being the penetrator of a man was acceptable.</p>
<p>According to the record, Gongmin also planned to resolve the problem of begetting an heir by having these young bodyguards rape his queens, something the ladies resisted threatening suicide but one of them relented when Gongmin threatened her at swordpoint.
These actions became the king&rsquo;s downfall when she fell pregnant from the rapes by Hong Ryun, a leading member of the Jajewi.
Gongmin, on being told by a eunuch Choi Mansaeng about the pregnancy, announced that he would have Hong Ryun killed&mdash;and then, inexplicably, told Choi Mansaeng that <em>he</em> would be killed as well for knowing this.
Somewhat unsurprisingly, Choi Mansaeng and Hong Ryun later burst into Gongmin&rsquo;s bedchamber where the king was in drunken slumber and stabbed him to death.</p>
<p>Though Gongmin did have a son, or said he did, there were so many doubts cast on the boy&rsquo;s birth that he never gained legitimacy and was ultimately executed by the rising coalition of soldiers and scholars who would ultimately bring down Goryeo and found the new kingdom of Joseon.
Gongmin never mentioned the boy until a few years after his birth, claiming he had made a royal visit to the late Shin Don&rsquo;s home where he lay with a female servant of Shin Don, Banya, who later gave birth to a boy.
After Shin Don&rsquo;s execution Gongmin brought the boy to the palace to be raised as a prince and be his heir, but even taking his story at face value the boy Wu had no right to be the king&rsquo;s heir because he was born outside recognized marriage or concubinage.
As it were, many doubted Wu&rsquo;s paternity and both Wu and his son Chang were later executed, and were called Shin Wu and Shin Chang as descendants of Shin Don rather than the royal surname of Wang.</p>
<p>Though we might not be able to take all of the <em>History of Goryeo</em> at face value especially at the end of the dynasty, by the <em>History&rsquo;s</em> framing King Gongmin&rsquo;s favors and immoral acts with men, together with an aversion to physical intimacy with women, perhaps compounded by what was viewed as an unusual and shameful level of affection for an infertile&mdash;and later dead&mdash;queen, contributed to the instability and fall of his kingdom.
It should be noted that a king having male lovers was not in itself problematic or unusual in the eyes of the history writers, but rather the shameful nature of some of these sexual acts together with the attempt to adulterate the royal line through cuckoldry.</p>

<h2 id="sossang-and-danji--15th-century--enslaved-women-in-a-known-sexual-relationship">Sossang and Danji (15th century): Enslaved women in a known sexual relationship</h2>
<p>Sossang and Danji were servants in the palace of the Joseon dynasty in its early years.
Sossang was a servant of the palace, meaning she was indentured to the state, while Danji was a private servant in the household of one of the Crown Prince&rsquo;s royal concubines.</p>
<p>According to the record, Sossang and Danji were in love and sometimes slept together, leaving no doubt that the relationship was sexual in nature.
The Crown Princess Consort at the time from the house of Bong, when later interrogated by her father-in-law the king, described how Sossang and Danji not only slept together at night but also embraced neck to neck and sucked each others&rsquo; tongues because they were &ldquo;always loving and joyful (常時愛好)&rdquo; with each other, in what may be the only surviving description of consenting erotic activity between women from premodern Korea.</p>
<p>Neither Sossang nor Danji had full freedom to marry of their own volition as enslaved persons, though enslavers might give their blessings or at least tolerate male-female unions involving the persons they had enslaved.
Nevertheless, it seemed these two had some space to have a relationship with each other which, if technically illegitimate, was at least a known phenomenon and one that was not particularly more stringently punished than male-female adultery, as discussed below.</p>
<p>Such female homosexual relationships and the women in them were almost never recorded, and the reason we know these two particular women&rsquo;s names and their relationship is because the aforementioned Crown Princess Consort Bong developed a sexual interest in Sossang and, per Sossang&rsquo;s accusation, raped the servant &ldquo;in form similar to a man lying with a woman.&rdquo;
The Crown Princess also stalked and spied on Sossang and Danji to keep them apart, and jealously kept the fearful Sossang by her side.</p>
<p>This coerced sexual relationship between the Princess Consort and Sossang became known to the palace, and as it was adultery by the Princess Consort against her husband the Crown Prince, it was viewed as a violation of the royal family&rsquo;s dignity and integrity and ultimately became the reason for the Princess&rsquo;s expulsion from her position.
The King considered the adultery with Sossang too shameful to publicly state as a reason for the expulsion, however, and named the Princess&rsquo;s other misdeeds instead, such as jealousy of her husband&rsquo;s concubines, peering at people outside through the servants&rsquo; outhouse walls, and improper handling of royal property.</p>
<p>The king who made this decision, Sejong, professed a particular hatred for such illegitimate assignations between female servants, enslaved women and others, and discussed how he would have them corporeally punished by 70 blows to the buttocks and 100 more on repeat offenses.
Given that these punishments used large wooden paddles, such beatings could result in not only injury but disability and even death.
Believing that Heaven had guided his heart to hate the practice of female homosexuality, he boasted of reducing this custom with such strict measures.
However, this was certainly not the last instance of recorded female homosexuality in the Joseon palace, as  later discussed.</p>

</figure>

<p>For context, it does not appear that female homosexuality was a particularly greater crime than illicit male-female sex.
In the <em>Great Laws of Ming (大明律)</em>, the criminal code of the Chinese Ming dynasty that became the basis of Joseon criminal law, the basic punishment for illegitimate sex between a man and woman who were not married to each other was 80 blows for both the man and woman, or 90 blows for a married woman.</p>
<p>Of course, it is doubtful that the law was enforced for unmarried men and women who had consenting sex, for both lack of social stigma for such activities and limitations in state resources.
However, Sejong&rsquo;s own prohibition of relationships between palace servants was not a blanket ban on female homosexuality throughout the land of Joseon either, but rather took place in the specific context of the palace which was at the center and source of the kingdom&rsquo;s Confucian rule, where even unmarried servants were held to a standard of conduct befitting the dignity of the royal household.</p>

<p>Also during the time of Sejong, a nobleman named Yi Seon was given high office and put in charge of Joseon&rsquo;s military.
The record of his promotion states three main points against Yi Seon&rsquo;s character that made him unfit for office, in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He is small-minded, stubborn, strange-tempered, arrogant, and is neither capable himself nor trusting of colleagues and subordinates, and thus almost always ruins the work wherever he goes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has a handsome male slave who he keeps in a room as he would a wife or concubine, who is indeed known in the neighborhood as Lord Yi&rsquo;s concubine.
This slave even goes willfully into the marital bedroom and sleeps with Yi Seon&rsquo;s wife, with the noise audible from the outside, something Yi Seon neither prohibits nor minds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has his servants go around digging under the walls of his neighbors, causing the neighbors to move away when the walls cave, and he promptly incorporates these lands as fields attached to his own compound.
He also incorporated a formerly communal well by putting a human corpse next to it and then walling it around when people stopped coming.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The perceived sexual inappropriateness of allowing his male lover to commit adultery with his wife, it seems, was considered to be equivalent with other character flaws of incompetence and avarice in one of the highest officials in the land.
This was not considered a criminal offense, however, (though the handling of property may well have constituted a crime if laws were properly enforced) nor even a disqualification given that Yi Seon continued to serve in high office.</p>

<p>A lady from the house Bak, the wife of Prince Je-an of the royal family, was alleged to have been in affairs with three maidservants.
Lady Bak herself maintained her innocence, saying that it was the maidservants who tried to seduce her, forcibly kissed her, and touched her breasts without her consent.</p>
<p>Under interrogation a maidservant confessed that the prince&rsquo;s nurse was behind it, trying to frame Lady Bak so the prince could remarry his former wife.
In the end, despite the lady&rsquo;s proven innocence, Prince Je-an convinced his kinsman King Seongjong to let him divorce Lady Bak and remarry his divorced wife Lady Kim.
Though this is not a case of consensual homosexual activity between women, it shows that female homosexuality was a known practice and was potentially marriage-ending and incriminating much like adultery with a man.</p>

<p>Palace attendants (內人, na&rsquo;in) and senior ladies (尙宮, sanggung) were a different class of women from the enslaved women who served at the palace, though in a broad sense they might all be called palace attendants (宮女 gungnyeo, 宮人 gung-in).
In the narrow sense, palace attendants were not menial laborers of the palace but professional assistants, craftswomen, and cooks who had their own maidservants.
The attendants were taught to read and write Hangul, and served the royals close by or were in charge of the royals&rsquo; food, clothing, and decorations.
The sanggung, meanwhile, were the senior management who gave orders to the na&rsquo;in.
The term &ldquo;attendants,&rdquo; for the purpose of this section, refers to this narrow sense of more elite palace workers, and will include the sanggung because they were promoted from the ranks of na&rsquo;in.</p>
<p>Attendants were born from a range of different classes, from enslaved to nobility.
Their special functions in the palace set them apart with certain significant benefits such as higher wages than most women of the time could command, social status, and a degree of leisure.
These privileges also entailed many restrictions, a major one being that they could not leave the palace except on special occasions, when expelled, or when sick or close to death.
Another was that they were forbidden to marry as they were technically sexually committed and available to the king, though this remained theoretical for almost all of these women and in practice it meant enforced celibacy.
Adultery with men was punishable by death, for instance.</p>
<p>There are seeming allegations of adultery with women as well, that is between each other or with outside women, though the references are not entirely clear and an oft-cited example does not appear to be about homosexuality at all.
That is, though it was alleged by some modern commentators that the reference in late 15th-century records to attendants sharing friendship (gyobung) with each other meant female homosexuality, punishable by being branded with the words &ldquo;illegal friendship (違法交朋), an examination of the primary record does not indicate anything sexual about these illegal friendships and the punishment for them but rather factionism/partisanship and breach of palace security.</p>
<p>Gyobung has been used elsewhere in the records in a political sense referring to &ldquo;factions of friends (朋堂)&rdquo; meaning partisanship that was widely decried as a source of political disorder and corruption.
The complaint about palace attendants&rsquo; gyobung, furthermore, was about attendants forming factions and leaking palace secrets, and from my reading there was no sexual content to these accusations.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
Nevertheless, given the listing of gyobung as a term for female homosexuality and leaving open the possibility that I may have missed some nuances and references as a non-expert researcher, I am mentioning these passages and linking to the online database entry so others may judge for themselves.</p>
<p>A somewhat likelier reference to female homosexuality by palace attendants is a complaint from the 18th century that attendants were consorting with crafty Buddhist nuns and lowborn widows and calling it daeshik.
Daeshik, as discussed above in the terminology section, means sharing meals together, in this context visits by friends from outside the palace, and was also a widespread term in premodern Korea for homosexuality.</p>
<p>In full context this complaint may also refer to the need for order and secrecy in the palace, as the immediately preceding passage discusses corruption and the leakage of palace secrets.
The use of the term daeshik is nevertheless suggestive, and may have been a veiled reference to the entwined problems of corruption, security breaches, and sexual inappropriateness in the palace.
This may have been as close to a reference as propriety allowed in open court.
This is in contrast to the passages involving Princess Consort Bong&rsquo;s rape of the maidservant Sossang, which recorded consultations made in secret between Sejong and his closest advisors because the matter was so sensitive.
Certainly, given how widespread the use of &ldquo;daeshik&rdquo; was, it is unlikely that a classically educated audience of courtiers were ignorant of the innuendo.</p>
<p>It is further worth noting that the crafty nuns and lowborn widows referenced in the complaint are female counterparts to the &ldquo;common ruffians and unseemly monks&rdquo; referenced by Yi Gyu-gyeong while discussing male homosexuality, see next section.
In this way, the daeshik custom between palace attendants presents a window into female homosexuality in other sections of society as well, where despite the kingdom&rsquo;s repressive mores the people were subject to far  less direct control in sexual matters.</p>
<p>As also noted in the section on Sossang and Danji, prohibitions and penalties were not unique to female homosexuality in a palace setting, with prohibitions against adultery with men being at least as heavy.
In fact by the time of King Yeongjo, when the above complaint was made, the laws had become considerably stricter for palace attendants who consorted with outside men, a crime made punishable by beheading both the man and woman in Yeongjo&rsquo;s time as opposed to corporeal punishment for sexual activity with women mentioned in Sejong&rsquo;s time three hundred years before.
There is no evidence of a ban on homosexuality, male or female, for the general populace.</p>
<p>Via Kang (2015), a number of scholars in the 18th and 19th centuries delved into the history of and terms for homosexuality, such as the origin and meaning of terms such as daeshik and namchong.
Of these, Yi Hakgyu explained the meaning of daeshik as a part of palace affairs and mentioned that it was quite popular at the time, providing farther record of daeshik as a continuing practice in the Joseon dynasty.</p>

<h2 id="ruffians-and-monks--18th-19th-centuries--practitioners-of-male-homosexuality">Ruffians and monks (18th-19th centuries): Practitioners of male homosexuality</h2>
<p>Yi Gyugyeong was an 18th to 19th century scholar whose greatest single work is the <em>Oju Yeonmun Jangjeon San-go</em> (五洲衍文長箋散稿), an encyclopedic compilation of over 1,400 entries comprising knowledge from around the world on a plethora of subjects from history and antiquity to science and agriculture.
Homosexuality was one of the many subjects Yi Gyugyeong wrote about, and in exploring the history of namchong with examples from China and Japan, he ends the article on a note critical of homosexuality.
&ldquo;Who says this is a beautiful custom to be shared across the world?
In our eastern land [Joseon], it is merely taught and learned among common ruffians and unseemly monks at temples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This offhand disapproving comment provides a window into the classes of men who were thought to engage in male homosexuality.
Together with the above-discussed complaints of &ldquo;crafty nuns and lowborn widows&rdquo; as purveyors of daeshik, it may be indicative of the intertwining of class and position with sexual inappropriateness such as homosexuality:
The unpropertied, unmarrigeable, and monastic outside the strict Confucian order built on the ideal of a propertied male-headed household.</p>
<p>Given the long and widespread practice of homosexuality in Korea, however, Yi Gyugyeong&rsquo;s claim of its confinement to certain defined and despised classes seems more based on ideal than fact.
Kings during the Goryeo dynasty were in open homosexual relationships, and a leading literary talent of the day wrote in praise of homosexual love.
Even in the early Joseon period there were high-ranking officials in open homosexual relationships, and there are persistent records of working-class women engaging in female homosexuality in the royal palace of Joseon.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Records from premodern Korea going back over 1,000 years attest to the existence of people who did not conform to strict ideas of cisnormativity and heteronormativity.
While the existence of homosexual, bisexual, and gender non-conforming people is a constant, there have been different understandings of attitudes toward their proclivities, from a gender inversion by Heaven to refined courtly love to social disorder and adultery against the King.
Queer people have always been here and are no Western invention, and understandings of our existence will always be contextual and dynamic.
One constant seems to be that the open existence of queer people outside of narrow constraints is construed as a threat to prevailing orders of patriarchy and property, or outside or parallel to such dominant order.
This may be the ultimate subsersive promise of queerness.
If queerness can threaten and dismantle kingdoms, what are the other possibilities?</p>

      <description>A remarkable new collection of translated Chinese poetry and original essays by the translator.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Note: I have received an advance copy of The Lantern and the Night Moths to write a review for Exchanges now <a href="https://exchanges.uiowa.edu/reviews/the-lantern-and-the-night-moths/">available on their website</a> and <a href="https://ljwrites.blog/posts/lantern-review-exchanges/">reproduced on this site</a>, but have also pre-ordered it on my own since.
This post was adapted from my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6276127275">Goodreads review</a> posted on February 19, 2024.
<em>The Lantern and the Night Moths</em> is available whereever books are sold!</p>

</figure>

<p><em>The Lantern and the Night Moths</em> (2024 Invisible Publishing) is a collection of modern and contemporary Chinese poetry translated by Yilin Wang and accompanied by Wang&rsquo;s original essays.
The diverse works and voices represented are made accessible by the lyrical, heartfelt translations no matter what the reader&rsquo;s relationship with the original language:
Shaky and uncertain in my case, but with no barriers to non-speakers and likely enjoyable even to fluent Chinese speakers for the lesser-traveled route through modernist Chinese poetry and the author&rsquo;s deft guide through poetics, literary history, and the art of translation.</p>
<p>It was quite the experience to be immersed in such different ages and styles in one volume, from feminist revolutionary Qiu Jin&rsquo;s fierce yearnings expressed in classical form, to early modernist Fei Ming&rsquo;s bridging between the old and new in experimental, enigmatic verse.
Poet-translator Dai Wangshu&rsquo;s wistful reflections, together with contemporary poets Zhang Qiaohui and Xiao Xi&rsquo;s everyday imagery and vivid poetic language, completed the journey through modernity to the present.</p>
<p>The effect is one of lively dialogue between these remarkable poets through their differences and convergences in style and imagery.
&ldquo;I shall declare, I have swept the dust of the world away,&rdquo; proclaims the rebellious warrior Qiu Jin, while Fei Ming philosophically muses, &ldquo;the universe is a particle of indestructible dust floating in the air.&rdquo;
Zhang Qiaohui patiently builds narrative in weighty blocks of language (&ldquo;a pseudo-classical reconstruction made of bricks and reinforced concrete/It comforts me with its mundanity&rdquo;) while Xiao Xi throws searing moments packaged in the rhythm of hyper-condensed language that beats with the consciousness of the now (&ldquo;some people . . . auction their kidneys off to pay for iPhones&rdquo;).
Dai Wangshu, a seasoned flyer between worlds of thought and language, casually melds Asian and European philosophy together (&ldquo;I think, therefore I am a butterfly&hellip;&rdquo;) and sinks deep into existential meditations that waver like a flame between meanings, skillfully captured by the translator.</p>
<p>A must-read for anyone with a stake in the art of poetry and its translation, <em>The Lantern and the Night Moths</em> is a unique and necessary collection that raises urgent questions about the future of translation and translators in an age of upheaval, where old forms of devaluation and exploitation&mdash;as brought home by the British Museum&rsquo;s uncredited and unpaid use of Wang&rsquo;s Qiu Jin translations for its 2023 exhibit&mdash;coexist with the new in the use of technological sleight-of-hand to erase and appropriate translators&rsquo; labor.
<em>The Lantern and the Night Moths</em> is both a literary treat and a clarion call that contains multitudes in a slim volume, a celebration, mourning, and hopeful anticipation of what has been and might yet be.</p>

      <title>Starting–and staying–small with housecleaning</title>
      <link>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/small-cleaning/</link>

      <description>On doing better and stressing less about the house with small, unambitious habits</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m not really good about keeping a tip-top house, and chances are I never will be.
Still, lately I&rsquo;ve been doing a little better and am feeling less stressed by giving myself permission to do things in small increments without feeling the need to turn the house upside down or do everything at once.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been aware for a while that I should do things in small increments, but it really came into focus for me with housekeeping advice videos I&rsquo;ve been listening to.
They all emphasized that cleaning is a matter of habit, not the occasional Herculean effort and helped me realize I&rsquo;d been psyching myself out of consistent cleaning by thinking I needed to take out a full day to get EVERYTHING done in one go.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that was how I was brought up, with my mom telling me I should do the whole house when I cleaned because otherwise the dirt would spread from the uncleaned rooms to the clean one.
So I ended up not cleaning on days I couldn&rsquo;t do the whole house, which was most days&hellip; all days&hellip; yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some truth in what she said and I know she meant to help and not sabotage me, but it turned out to be unhelpful once I started keeping a home.
I&rsquo;m not a stay-at-home mom the way she was, I work for income in a home that&rsquo;s still in the process of decluttering.
Daily full house-cleaning is just not in the cards at this point.
The dirt-spreading effect is also greatly reduced if rooms are cleaned on rotation because there&rsquo;s less dirt overall to spread around.
It&rsquo;s a heck of a lot better than not getting started in the first place, don&rsquo;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good enough, etc.</p>
<p>Once I accepted my starting point and circumstances instead of holding myself to standards for a completely different situation, I could start cleaning and tidying in bits and pieces rather than try to do everything all at once or organize a Grand Day of Reckoning after which everything would be perfect.
Not like I&rsquo;m opposed to big cleaning days, they can be satisfying and helpful, but a) they are intimidating to arrange and get started on, and b) I know myself well enough to realize that without a consistent habit things are going to fall apart around my ears again.
Ask me how I know.
<em>Cries in years of exhausted ADHD working parent</em></p>
<p>In recent days I&rsquo;ve been setting myself limited tasks every day, ideally with just one focus, such as &ldquo;get the gross grease and food gunk off the kitchen floor with Magic Blocks and elbow oil. Yeah, just the floor, do not do the counters, do not clean the oven,&rdquo; or &ldquo;sweep the home office floor&mdash;yeah I know it&rsquo;s a huge cluttered mess, we can get to that, just clean the reachable parts, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And you know what?
Things are better.
Not perfect, I can still identify problems everywhere I look, but floors are cleaner and don&rsquo;t feel disgusting to walk on.
It gives me more energy and confidence to start working on bigger-ticket items, like space management in the home office, the big&hellip; basically&hellip; pile of garbage on the verandah, and the related entanglements of family-given items we don&rsquo;t have a use for, the organizational issues of tossing vs. rehoming, guilt about potentially creating so much waste and so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay.
We&rsquo;ll figure it out as we go.
Not in one fell swoop, not on a Day of Salvation that will be the end of our problems, but bit by bit as time goes on and while we&rsquo;re kind to ourselves moving the business of Life along.</p>
<p>This morning my husband and I cleaned the living room sitting mat and the floor underneath which was ick but doable, and we felt a lot better afterward.
That&rsquo;s our cleaning for today.
Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll probably wipe down and clean the big bedroom floor.
That&rsquo;ll be it for tomorrow.
Eventually we&rsquo;ll figure out things that take more organization and have more moving pieces, and we&rsquo;ll get there.
We will gradually, inexorably, habitually unfuck our habitat and feel more in control and relaxed about the house.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll never live in a magazine-ready home but it&rsquo;ll be cozy and ours, which is what counts.
I know it works, because it&rsquo;s already working and we&rsquo;ll keep at it.
It&rsquo;ll be okay.
Never perfect, but okay.</p>

      <title>[Review] Sad Sacked by Liz Alterman</title>

      <description>This memoir of a middle-class family&amp;rsquo;s brush with unemployment was funny and vivid in parts, but ultimately unsatisfying.</description>

Also included are review excerpts, &#39;Will have you laughing and crying... you need this book&#39; and &#39;A sweaty, funny examination into suburban marriage.&#39;"/> 
</figure>

<p>I was given an advance reader copy of this book through <a href="https://booksirens.com/">BookSirens</a>.
This post is an edited version of the  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6460306678?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=like_notification&amp;ref_=pe_7171740_475446060">Goodreads review</a> I posted.
If you care about spoilers for non-fiction books, this review contains a discussion of the ending.</p>
<p>Also a warning for discussion of interpersonal antisemitism, which I did not include in the original Goodreads review.</p>
<p>Sad Sacked is a humorous and vividly-written exploration of a U.S. middle-class suburban family&rsquo;s brush with financial insecurity when the author&rsquo;s husband Rich loses his job and the family lives for a year on his severance package.
The whole time the author scrambles to keep everything together, taking on crappy writing jobs to pay the bills while trying to motivate Rich to get a new job.</p>
<p>I sympathized deeply with the author&rsquo;s growing anxiety and frustration as the shadow of her husband&rsquo;s unemployment grew longer and financial apocalypse loomed, all the while squeezed by the pressure to keep up with the Jones in her affluent New Jersey neighborhood.
It&rsquo;s both an intimate portrayal of one family&rsquo;s struggle and a dark look into the evaporation of employment and financial security even for the more affluent classes of U.S. society and elsewhere.</p>
<p>That said, I found the narrative ultimately limited by a seeming inability to think outside the status quo.
(This is solely based on what was in the book, of course, since no doubt a lot more took place in real life than could be written about.)
I found myself annoyed by the author and her husband&rsquo;s seeming unwillingness to communicate about what seemed like conflicting goals and wants.
The possibility of moving to a less expensive neighborhood is brought up but never seriously discussed or planned for in the narrative of the book, even though Rich drags his feet on looking for a new job for half a year.
It&rsquo;s mentioned from the start that he&rsquo;s unhappy and disenchanted with his job, yet this appears to be dismissed as unimportant in the overriding quest to keep the family in their current lifestyle and neighborhood.</p>
<p>This unwillingness to communicate builds up resentments and ugly fights between the couple as pressures and anxieties mount, culminating in an antisemitic moment over the holidays when the author tells her husband that Christmas&mdash;a holiday he had been celebrating with her and their three children all their marriage and possibly before&mdash;isn&rsquo;t his holiday.</p>
<p>It felt weird  because there&rsquo;s no self-reflection in the book about making such a hurtful and exclusionary comment, or a serious apology from what I could tell.
It&rsquo;s even more surreal because the very next scene is of their neighbor making a comment stereotyping Jewish people and the author, while recognizing the bigotry, doesn&rsquo;t push back against it.
So what I get out of what Liz Alterman has chosen to present in her own memoir, leaving aside the complexities of real life that I&rsquo;m not privy to, is that she gets bigoted toward her own husband when she&rsquo;s angry enough, doesn&rsquo;t apologize for it, and also doesn&rsquo;t defend him when others are bigoted against him.
That was certainly a choice.</p>
<p>Moving on to the ending: I usually wouldn&rsquo;t discuss endings in a review of a book that has a narrative, even non-fiction, but it&rsquo;s a big chunk of what spoiled (heh) the book for me so I figured I&rsquo;d go into it.
Spoiler alert, the husband does get a new and higher-paying job at the last minute as his severance runs out.
The family get to keep the house and go on as before.
Yay, all&rsquo;s well that ends well, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately it rang hollow for me, because the only thing the couple seems to have learned from this time in their life is that they need to be grateful, not take anything for granted, and work hard.
Evidently it doesn&rsquo;t matter that the husband was miserable working in this field.
No, he should be grateful to have a job at all and he&rsquo;s learned his lesson!
Don&rsquo;t even think about the possibility of a new career/lifestyle or stepping off the light-speed social prestige treadmill, just keep your head down, say yes sir and yes ma&rsquo;am, and keep working!</p>
<p>The final chapter/epilogue where the author states these lessons felt creepily docile and saccharine, so unlike the verve and humor that had attracted me to the book in the first place.
Maybe that&rsquo;s appropriate for an ending that may read on the surface as happy but is actually one of accepting the status quo and learning to comply with it.
This lack of imagination, this beaten-down acquiescence to social pressure, may be the most sadsack thing about Sad Sacked.</p>

      <description>Fact-checking the 2023 short story The Schwarzschild Defence because I am a killjoy.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post was adapted from a <a href="https://writeout.ink/@ljwrites/109724660651747328">Mastodon post</a> I wrote on January 21, 2023.</p>
<h2 id="read-the-story-first">Read the story first!</h2>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/SZbHa">The Schwarzschild Defence</a> (2023) by M. V. Melcer is a very fun short science fiction story and highly recommended reading.
UPDATE (June 23, 2024): Given the story is now paywalled, I replaced the link with an archived version.
I particularly love its punchy style that delivers so much in so few words.
Its choices are effective for the story told, from the format giving only one side of the interview to the downright chilling twists, delivered so nonchalantly.
It feels fresh while maintaining a classic sci-fi feel, down to the commentary on gender roles and violence against women (consider that a content warning).</p>
<p>Still, I can&rsquo;t be the only one who thinks the argument as presented doesn&rsquo;t work legally or even physics-wise, right?
If you like overthinking things, and more importantly if you&rsquo;ve read the story, maybe you&rsquo;d like  to join me in overthinking a delightful story!</p>
<p>Seriously. Read it. It&rsquo;s less than a thousand words and brilliantly written. I&rsquo;ll wait.</p>
<h2 id="checking-the-laws">Checking the laws</h2>
<p>So, can you see which parts don&rsquo;t hold up?
Legally speaking, even if we take the narrator of the story, let&rsquo;s call her &ldquo;Mileva,&rdquo; at her word that Xavier will not die (a claim I highly doubt, see below), she has by her admission committed some pretty serious crimes.</p>
<p>One is the crime of false imprisonment, meaning detaining someone against their will without legal justification.
Mileva sabotaged Xavier into an inescapable prison and there&rsquo;s no way this doesn&rsquo;t count as false imprisonment, <em>especially</em> when she was reckless enough to admit at least twice to the police that this wasn&rsquo;t what Xavier intended or wanted with the flight.</p>
<p>In the jurisdiction I live in, false imprisonment carries a penalty of up to 10 years&rsquo; incarceration if committed against a spouse or other close family member.
Committing cruel acts against a close family member while keeping them falsely imprisoned carries a penalty of at <em>least</em> 2 years&rsquo; imprisonment.
The penalty is increased by up to 50% if the false imprisonment is done with the possession of a dangerous object, and both the black hole and the tampered-with spaceship arguably qualify.</p>
<p>Overall, Mileva is looking at some pretty heavy charges and had better get her lawyers scrambling.
Given the severity of the effects, the incontrovertible evidence, and her intent, freely admitted to a police detective&mdash;without a lawyer to advise her, what was she thinking?!&mdash;to trap Xavier in the black hole, it is <em>very</em> likely she will have the book thrown at her.</p>
<p>Mileva has also, by her admission, tampered with sensitive equipment, damaging Xavier&rsquo;s property knowing he is undertaking a dangerous and sensitive flight.
Through this she caused Xavier to make unwanted contact with the event horizon of the black hole, which is battery.</p>
<p>Even <em>if</em> Xavier suffers no other physical harm (which I doubt, more on that soon), slowing down his physical process well beyond human levels is unwanted interference with his body, a form of inflicted physical injury that exacerbates the crimes of false imprisonment and battery.
I&rsquo;m sure there have been more crimes committed, but these are some of the big ones.</p>
<h2 id="checking-the-laws-of-physics">Checking the laws of physics</h2>
<p>The charges outlined above rest on Mileva&rsquo;s insistence that Xavier is physically unharmed and will live a long, long time in the black hole.
But will he?
I&rsquo;m not formally trained in physics so I&rsquo;m on less certain ground here, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem that way to me, and discussions like <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/fall_in.html">this one</a> seem to confirm my suspicion.</p>
<p>If time slows down as you go down a black hole and the gravitational pull becomes inescapable, wouldn&rsquo;t the parts of the spaceship and of Xavier be pulled down at different rates, meaning he and the spaceship will be literally atomized?
If anything he&rsquo;s going to have the longest, most protracted death ever.
Not that I care, the guy&rsquo;s an ass and deserves it, but the whole twist of the story depends on Mileva&rsquo;s actions not being murder.</p>
<p>I mean maybe Mileva is right, and the story was worded very cleverly here, that this Xavier-molasses and his eventual atom-level dissolution will happen so slowly in a Schwarzschild black hole, at a time scale well beyond everyone&rsquo;s lifespans, that it can&rsquo;t be murder in the conventional sense.
Murder revolves around the idea of cutting someone&rsquo;s life short, so what do you do when someone stretches it <em>out,</em> longer and longer beyond the shape lives were ever meant to take, before a horrible end?</p>
<p>This is why I believe the better legal tacks to take are false imprisonment, battery, and attendant serious injury with property damage and sabotage sprinkled in for spice.
But under no circumstance can Mileva get away scot-free as she claims.</p>
<h2 id="notes-and-conclusions">Notes &amp; conclusions</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to note this isn&rsquo;t me endorsing the incarceral state, far less the misogyny and threats Mileva was subjected to by her account.
All I&rsquo;m doing is analyzing the internal logic of the story, which is remarkable for raising these questions at all.
If Isaac Asimov in his classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Billiard_Ball">The Billiard Ball</a> (1967) can stretch, or shall we say fail to stretch, the science in almost exactly the same way,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  I don&rsquo;t see why M. V. Melcer can&rsquo;t be afforded the same leniency.
Science fiction is <em>fiction</em> in the end, and between perfect fidelity to the facts and a good story there&rsquo;s no harm in choosing the latter.</p>
<p>I also think that, if we read the story &ldquo;straight&rdquo; along with the fact-checking, a very different reading can emerge than the original impression of a domestic violence survivor putting her abuser away from good and walking away cackling with his fortune:
Instead the story can become one of a traumatized survivor who saved herself with an unthinkable act of desperation that has changed her forever, and ended up self-sabotaging herself in her panic and inability to accept the reality of what she&rsquo;s done.
That&rsquo;s another thing about fiction, that it&rsquo;s roomy enough for different interpretations, and arguably it&rsquo;s a great story that can admit so many readings in such an economy of words.</p>

      <description>Before Koreans knew smallpox as a virus, we knew her as a god.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Note: This essay in earlier form was originally posted in 2020 to the now-defunct history.expert, during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-god-of-plague-and-the-story-of-cheoyong">On the god of plague and the story of Cheoyong</h2>
<p>Content note: Mythological events that may be read as sexual violence or adultery.</p>
<p>Before Koreans knew smallpox as a virus, we knew her as a god.
With no way to prevent this terrible infectious disease which had a mortality rate of up to 80% and often left survivors scarred and disabled, we called smallpox by names like “Great Lady” or “Great Guest.”</p>
<p>You could not try to exorcise or even use medicine against the Lady-God; you offered her food and prayed to her in the hope she would spare your loved one, who all too often was a child.
Make her angry by disrespecting her, and she could kill the patient or leave them alive but badly scarred, even blinded.</p>
<p>Though the god of smallpox has been personified as different genders and forms from all walks of life, as befitting a disease that could be spread and suffered by anyone, the most familiar shamanic representation is that of a beautiful young woman and that is the version I will go with.</p>

<p>Now, one figure from the Korean kingdom of Silla in the late ninth century earned the respect and repentance of this terrible and formidable god.
This man, Cheoyong(處容), has a strange story of his own:</p>
<p>Heon-gang, the king of Silla at the time, was returning from a seaside excursion when all of a sudden cloud and fog rolled in, causing the entire party to lose their way.
The royal sun-administrator, as the weather official who was also in charge of weather-related omens and divination, advised the king that this was the work of the Dragon King of the East Sea, who should be appeased by some good deed.</p>
<p>Though the king was skeptical, no one could see anything because of the strange weather and he had to do something.
He ordered a temple be built in that place for the dragon; the instant he said the words, the fog and clouds disappeared.</p>
<p>Pleased at this respectful treatment from the king, the Dragon of the East Sea appeared before the royal retinue with his seven sons to dance and play music, praising the king’s virtue.
The dragon then left one of his sons, Cheoyong, with the king to aid him at the capital.
The king, happy to have the Dragon’s son by his side, arranged his match to a beautiful woman and gave him a high office to have him settle in the capital.</p>
<p>Cheoyong’s wife was very beautiful, and was admired by all. The god of plague, enamored of her, transformed to come to Cheoyong’s house and secretly lie in his wife’s bed.
Cheoyong came home late at night to look upon his bed, only to see two people in it.
One was his wife, but he did not recognize the other.
At the sight he withdrew, dancing and singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>東京明期月良<br />
夜入伊遊行如可<br />
入良沙寢矣見昆<br />
脚烏伊四是良羅<br />
二兮隐吾下於叱古<br />
二兮隐誰支下焉古<br />
本矣吾下是如馬於隐<br />
奪叱良乙何如爲理古<br />
<br />
Through the city in the light of the moon<br />
I did frolic in the deep of night<br />
I look upon the couch on coming home<br />
And four legs greet my astonished sight.<br />
Two were mine<br />
Whose are the other two?<br />
What once was mine<br />
Was taken, what can I do?<br /></p>
</div>
<p>The god of plague showed her true form and knelt before Cheoyong, contrite.
Said she, “I envied your wife and have now violated her.
Yet you showed no anger at the sight, and this beautiful conduct has moved me deeply.
I swear to you, if I but see your form in paint I will not enter that door.”</p>
<p>This was how people started putting up portraits of Cheoyong to deter plague and for good luck.
The temple the king built for the dragon was called Mang-hae-sa (望海寺), the Temple of the Ocean View.
Cheoyong&rsquo;s song and dance named for him have been passed on to posterity and the dance is performed to this day, designated as a <a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/cheoyongmu-00189">UNESCO intangible heritage</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-middle-eastern-hypothesis-of-cheoyong-s-origin">The Middle Eastern hypothesis of Cheoyong&rsquo;s origin</h2>
<p>One intriguing hypothesis about Cheoyong’s identity is that he was an Arab or Persian merchant, possibly a doctor.
Though there are no explicit records, traders from the Middle East may have been in Silla at this time.
At the very least Silla was known in the Middle East, with scholars such as Ibn Khurdaziba in the ninth century writing about Silla as a land beyond China where Muslims happily settled because it was a such a good and plentiful land&mdash;as Cheoyong did in the story.
In the Persian epic poem <em>Kush-Nama</em> the hero Abtin marries Fararang, a princess of Basila which is alleged to be a mythical version of Silla.</p>
<p>Also, the later Korean dynasty of Goryeo clearly did engage in trade with the Islam world.
Not only are there records of large trading parties from the land of Daesik (對食國), meaning Arabia, the name “Korea” itself became known to the West through Middle Eastern merchants.
It is an intriguing possibility that exchange between the Korean Peninsula and the Middle East started even before it was formally recorded in the Goryeo era, with the tale of Cheoyong passed down as a mythologized hint much like Ibn Khurdaziba&rsquo;s writings on Silla or the adventures of the <em>Kush-Nama</em>.</p>
<p>The accounts of Cheoyong’s appearance before the king are suggestive as well.
The fact that he and his family rose out of the sea could be a mythologized rendition of their seafaring, while their strange appearance and clothing astonished the Korean onlookers and caused them to call the strangers “spirits of the sea.”
More specifically, Cheoyong was said to have deep-set eyes and a prominent nose, features that have been preserved in an exaggerated form in his portraiture and the mask performers wear for his dance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://ljwrites.blog/img/history/cheoyong-mask.jpg" alt="A dancer in a mask representing Cheoyong. The dark-faced mask smiles wide. Its rugged features include deep-set eyes, prominent nose and cheekbones, and facial hair."  />

<p>The Islamic world also had some of the most advanced medical knowledge in the world at this time, building on the preserved knowledge from the classical world and adding to it with innovation and observation.
The year 879 when Cheoyong was said to have come from the sea was early in the career of Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (854-925), a Persian doctor and polymath who wrote a pioneering book on smallpox and measles.</p>
<p>If Cheoyong were a Middle Eastern man with medical knowledge he may well have had access to the kind of research and methods Al-Razi used, if not the specific book, which may have enabled him to treat people afflicted with smallpox.
These events may then have been mythologized as Koreans at the time understood it, a ceremonial appeasement of the smallpox god, making him an enduring legend and himself a beloved god in our pantheon.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion-solidarity-in-times-of-plague">In conclusion: Solidarity in times of plague</h2>
<p>Cheoyong’s exact identity and background, including whether he was a real person, will always remain mysterious and up for debate.
Nevertheless, the possibility that he was an Arab or Persian is particularly poignant at a time when COVID-19 is bringing out virulent xenophobia and racism around the world.
Cheoyong may well have been a foreigner risking his life in a strange land to help patients struck with a deadly and highly contagious disease.</p>
<p>And now, 1,100 years later, Iran is hard hit by the disease and by the sanctions that are undercutting its response.
It is requesting Korea’s aid to secure more testing kits for citizens, an effort made difficult by the sanctions imposed against it.
This may very well be the time Korea can repay the debt it owes Cheoyong.
Wouldn’t such beautiful conduct move even the fearsome god of plague?</p>

<p>The differences are very indicative of our styles, I think, and I enjoyed the understated and quietly intense lyricism and voice of Zoë&rsquo;s rendition.
Whereas I, as always, prefer classical iambic metre for classical poetry and use it to build up to big, dramatic emotions.</p>

      <title>Writing year in review: My 2022 writing habit on Emacs</title>
      <link>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/2022-writing-review/</link>

      <description>What is most meaningful to me about my writing habit is that the dream of writing this story is no longer a dream, but my waking reality.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My New Year&rsquo;s resolution for 2022 was to write 300 words every day on the first draft of my big fiction project.
Plot twist, I actually stuck to it!
Just don&rsquo;t ask about the state of my physical activity habit, please.</p>
<p>Here are the year&rsquo;s writing statistics from writing most days from January 2 to December 31, 2022, taken using functionalities and packages of Emacs Org Mode, and my takeaways from these numbers.</p>
<h2 id="the-words-and-the-hours">The words and the hours</h2>
<p>According to a word count and Org Mode&rsquo;s <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/The-clock-table.html">clock table</a> report, I wrote somewhere around <strong>170,000 words</strong> this year in 11 days, 2 hours, and 9 minutes, or around <strong>266 hours of writing.</strong></p>
<p>These numbers come with some caveats:
The word count function does give me an exact count, 174,369, but this is an overcount that includes elements that won&rsquo;t be exported such as header (scene) labels, in-file notes, and time stamps.
This works for me, since I only need a rough estimate of where I am and not a laser-precise word count.
Besides, even considering the overcount I know this is Too Much!
I&rsquo;m going to hate my first-draft self once I have my editing hat on, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>The hours spent writing are similarly imprecise.
I started using Org Mode&rsquo;s <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Clocking-commands.html">clocking commands</a> fairly early in the year (January 5) to start keeping track of writing time, and there&rsquo;s some undercount from the first few days when the clock was not used.
Discounting that fairly small gap, which can&rsquo;t be by more than 2 hours, I was also inconsistent at times about running the clock.
Sometimes I ran the clock but was not writing, and at other times it was the other way around, though this was rarer.
For these reasons both the word count and reported time are more estimates than exact measures.</p>
<h2 id="words-per-hour-and-day">Words per hour and day</h2>
<p>Keeping those limitations in mind, a very rough estimate of my writing speed this year was <strong>639 words/hour</strong>, and I wrote an average of <strong>465 words a day</strong> during the year, counting the skipped days.
On the days I did write the average was <strong>544 words a day</strong>.</p>
<p>The estimated hourly word rate largely matches up with what I&rsquo;ve sensed on a regular day of writing, that I tend to produce about 100 words per 10 minutes or maybe a little more.
The per-day rate is a bit of a surprise, given that my goal was to write 300 words a day and I often did stop at almost exactly 300 words, especially on days the words weren&rsquo;t coming.
I guess it makes sense though, since I did overachieve a lot of days, by a lot at times.</p>
<p>The ironic/interesting part is, I think it was my keeping the goal at 300 words that allowed me to write an average of 500 words a day.
A lot of days I could only bear to start writing because I told myself I just had to do 300 words, and actually stopped at 300 when I was struggling and tired.
There were many days I could not have started at all at the thought of having to write 500 words a day, and that would have meant a lot fewer words.</p>
<h2 id="habit-consistency-and-achievement">Habit consistency and achievement</h2>
<p>In addition to writing and getting these stats in Org Mode, I had also been tracking my writing <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html">as a habit</a>.
At the end of 2022 I used a neat package called <a href="https://github.com/ml729/org-habit-stats">org-habit-stats</a> to get a calendar view and some statistics on the writing habit.</p>
<p>According to the statistics, I wrote <strong>312 days</strong> out of the year, or <strong>85%</strong> of days in 2022.
Nearly a third of the missed days come from February when I was having a hard time keeping up with writing, as seen in this calendar view of writing statistics:</p>
<figure>

         alt="Marked calendar view of habit from January to March with a handful of days missing from January and March, and more than half the days missing from February."/> 
</figure>

<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://ljwrites.blog/img/emacs/org-habit-stat-4-6.png"
         alt="Calendar view from April to June with two days missing from each month."/> 
</figure>

<figure>

         alt="Calendar view from July to September with two to four days missing from each month."/>

<figure>

         alt="Calendar view from October to December with three to four days missing from each month."/> 
</figure>

<p>As you can see I generally wrote on most days of the month, usually missing two to four days in a month.
Those would have been the days when I was overwhelmed by work or family obligations, or just needed a break.</p>
<p>The one outlier is February, when I was missing over half the days of the month.
This was likely because I was wrapping up my last academic gig during that month before I turned to full-time translation in March, something that made a huge difference in my free time and energy levels.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t as though I became a different person with more energy or &ldquo;willpower&rdquo; between the end of February and the start of March.
I had simply structured my life in a way that made room for writing and that made all the difference, which may be the true takeaway from this year of writing.</p>
<h2 id="numbers-for-what-they-re-worth">Numbers, for what they&rsquo;re worth</h2>
<p>Word count and hours spent writing are just numbers at the end of the day&ndash;or year, as it were.
They&rsquo;re mostly meaningful to me as an indication for how far I&rsquo;ve come, even as I realize how far I still have to go.
The story has grown in length far beyond my original expectations and I&rsquo;m just slogging on to get to the end of my originally envisioned story, so I can turn around to figure out stuff like editing (I expect to cut extravagantly) and book divisions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d frankly have been happier to have reached the end of my draft than to have written so many words, but I&rsquo;m letting the process take control for now as I try to feel out the world and narrative by writing through them.
Stats are one part of that journey but far from the whole experience, any more than kilometers and hours driven can tell you about the scenery seen outside the window or the smell of the car seats.</p>
<p>What is most meaningful to me about my writing habit is that the dream of writing this story is no longer a dream but my waking reality, and that it <em>will</em> be done at some point barring some huge, unforeseen change.
I know I am moving toward the endpoint, steadily if slowly.
Once I get there, I will know the key was the momentum of consistent habit.</p>

      <title>Object storage on Mastodon with a Backblaze B2 bucket</title>
      <link>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/mastodon-b2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/mastodon-b2/</guid>
      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s how I set up a Backblaze B2 bucket with a local proxy for Mastodon object storage.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="a-little-background-and-why-b2">A little background &amp; why B2?</h2>
<p>It was kind of background knowledge for me that object storage was an option in Mastodon hosting, but I never felt much need for it on my tiny instance.
Then it became an urgent issue when fedi activity exploded in November in the wake of the Twitter meltdown.
My instance database started crashing from the 40 GB local drive overflowing with cached media, and constantly ran at above 30 GB even when I left only one day&rsquo;s worth of cache at media cleanup (<code>tootctl media remove --days 1</code>).</p>
<p>I already had a Backblaze/B2 account that I had been using for my personal offsite backups, and I calculated that I could similarly hook it up to my Hometown/Mastodon instance at a fraction of the cost of adding more storage volume to the Hetzner server.
I also wanted to keep using B2 for this rather than create a new account with AWS or some other storage service, feeling no need to complicate things with yet another account and service to keep track of.</p>
<p>The problem I ran into was that this particular combination of Mastodon and B2 is <em>woefully</em> underdocumented, even with B2&rsquo;s S3-compatibility.
This led me into a lot of trial and error because the documentation I did find was outdated<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and/or did not mention issues unique to B2, like a huge authentication pitfall that I ended up pitching headfirst into.</p>
<p>Let me discuss that pitfall first, in case you don&rsquo;t need the rest of this guide:
<strong>You need to use a B2 application key, NOT a master application key, for this purpose.</strong>
If, like me, you have everything set up correctly and media uploads fail for an unexplained reason, this might be why.
More details in Step 1 below.</p>
<p>So here it is, the walkthrough of the process and settings that I wished I had when I configured my setup, put together from other sources and my own trial and error.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-set-up-a-b2-bucket-and-application-key-for-your-instance">Step 1: Set up a B2 bucket and application key for your instance</h2>
<p>This part is going to be pretty obvious if you already use B2.
Otherwise, the <a href="https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803542610-Creating-a-B2-Bucket-using-the-Web-UI">official tutorial for creating a bucket</a> should be enough.
Everything I have read says the privacy setting of the bucket should be public, though this comes at a risk because it means anyone can download from the bucket which could potentially eat into your traffic limit and cost you.
If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, you might have to verify your email to set the bucket to public.</p>
<p>Make note of the bucket&rsquo;s address, which will be the endpoint noted in your bucket information preceded by your bucket name.
If you named your bucket <code>my-instance-media</code> your bucket address would be something like:</p>
<p>my-instance-media.s3.us-west-900.backblazeb2.com</p>
<p>You can verify this by uploading a file to the bucket and viewing the address of the file, which will be something like:</p>
<p>my-instance-media.s3.us-west-900.backblazeb2.com/my-test-file.txt</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a B2 application key, <a href="https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052129034-Creating-and-Managing-Application-Keys">their official tutorial</a> should get you started.
Also, as discussed above, make sure you use a <strong>non-master</strong> application key pair for this setup in Step 4 below.
Master application keys are <a href="https://kb.msp360.com/cloud-vendors/backblazeb2/backblazeb2-as-s3compatible">NOT S3-compatible</a> (see &ldquo;Warning&rdquo;), and if you set up your <code>.env.production</code> with it your setup will not work!</p>
<p>Note down the application key id-application key pair in a secure location such as your password manager, especially the application key which will only be shown once and never again in your browser interface or otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-set-up-a-proxy-on-nginx">Step 2: Set up a proxy on nginx</h2>
<p>As noted in the official Mastodon documentation, it is very much recommended that you set up a proxy local to the server to cache  media requested from the bucket on your server.
If every request were to go directly to your bucket your traffic meter could climb rapidly and cost you more money than it has to.
I modeled my nginx configuration for this on <a href="https://thomas-leister.de/en/mastodon-s3-media-storage/">a configuration for a different S3-compatible service</a>, and followed the directions in the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/object-storage-proxy/">Mastodon documentation</a> on configuring the proxy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what my configuration, anonymized to <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/files.example.com</code>, looks like:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The specific addresses and names should be customized to your desired settings, as marked in the configuration text.</p>
<p>When the configuration file is written to your satisfaction, save it and symlink it from <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled</code>, and reload nginx by running (with <code>sudo</code> if you are not the <code>root</code> user here):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/files.example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>systemctl reload nginx
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then get a SSL certificate for the domain, as seen in the Mastodon documentation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>certbot --nginx -d files.example.com
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>systemctl reload nginx
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This was the main place I diverged from the configuration posted on the thomas-leister.de website, by the way:
I use port 443 for an encrypted connection per the Mastodon documentation rather than 80 for an unencrypted one like Thomas Leister did, mainly because the unencrypted connection broke all the images on my instance lol.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-upload-existing-mastodon-media-to-your-bucket">Step 3: Upload existing Mastodon media to your bucket</h2>
<p>If your instance is already in use, you should upload previously downloaded media to the instance bucket.
There are several different tools to achieve this, and if you already use an S3-compatible tool like <code>aws</code> or <code>s3cmd</code> it should do the job.
Just be aware that you&rsquo;ll need to use an S3-compatible <strong>non</strong>-master B2 application key to authenticate it, as discussed.</p>
<p>I used the official <code>b2</code> command line tool, since it&rsquo;s a simple binary and fairly easy to use.
I downloaded b2 for Linux through the link on <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/quick_command_line.html">this page</a>, uploaded it to the <code>/home/mastodon/live</code> directory (though in hindsight its <code>bin</code> subdirectory would have been more fitting), changed the owner to the mastodon user with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo chown mastodon:mastodon b2-linux
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Switched to the mastodon user:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo su - mastodon
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Changed the file name to <code>b2</code> for simplicity&rsquo;s sake:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>mv b2-linux b2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Also gave it execution permission.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>chmod +x b2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I didn&rsquo;t mess with <code>$PATH</code> or anything like that, since this wasn&rsquo;t going to be an everyday operation.</p>
<p>You can then create an authentication profile using the application key ID and application key pair generated in Step 1 above.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>./b2 authorize-account --profile my-instance $B2_Application_Key_ID $B2_Application_Key
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The variables <code>$B2_Application_Key_ID</code> and <code>$B2_Application_Key</code> should be replaced by the actual values, of course.
Or you can actually define the variables I guess, but I didn&rsquo;t feel the need since authentication was a one-time thing and, once successful, the switch <code>--profile my-instance</code> is enough to authenticate all operations.</p>
<p>After setting up the profile with <code>authorize-account</code> you can use some short, harmless command like list-buckets to test whether authentication works:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>./b2 list-buckets --profile my-instance
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Or maybe try uploading a small file or something.
The <code>--help</code> switch is helpful for figuring out the commands and syntax, or simply running b2 without any arguments will also bring up the help options.</p>
<p>Once authentication is confirmed to work, sync the <code>public/system</code> directory to the remote b2 bucket using the <code>sync</code> command.
If you haven&rsquo;t already, it&rsquo;s a good idea to run some <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/tootctl/#media-remove">media cleanup commands</a> to minimize the amount of files to upload to the bucket.
Here are the ones I used, from <code>/home/mastodon/bin</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  ./tootctl media remove --days <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>./tootctl media remove --prune-profiles
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>./tootctl media remove --remove-headers
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When you are ready to start moving the files, assuming the command is run from the <code>/home/mastodon/live</code> directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>./b2 sync --profile my-instance ./public/system/ b2://my-instance-media/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can read more about  <a href="https://b2-command-line-tool.readthedocs.io/en/master/subcommands/sync.html">b2&rsquo;s sync command options</a>, but I found the default options satisfactory.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-mastodon-configuration">Step 4: Mastodon configuration</h2>
<p>My Mastodon configuration in <code>live/.env.production</code> to enable the object storage looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>S3_ENABLED<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>true

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>S3_ENDPOINT<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>https://s3.us-west-900.backblazeb2.com
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In addition to the earlier point that the application key ID and application key pair should have been generated as a non-master application key, also note the <code>https://</code> in front of the <code>S3_ENDPOINT</code> value.
For me that was the final hurdle to getting the setup to work.</p>
<p>Switch to admin or some other user with <code>sudo</code> power.
From the mastodon user, it just takes an <code>exit</code> command in my case. Restart the Mastodon processes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo systemctl restart mastodon-*.service
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Check if the instance works normally.
If it&rsquo;s down, the API call to Backblaze storage may be failing and the key id and application key values should be double-checked.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-check-if-object-storage-is-working">Step 5: Check if object storage is working</h2>
<p>As discussed in the <a href="https://thomas-leister.de/en/mastodon-s3-media-storage/">Thomas Leister writeup</a> (&ldquo;Checking if it works&rdquo;), check the browser&rsquo;s console to see if the correct server proxy is loading up for media, and whether media are properly displayed.</p>
<p>Also, try attaching a piece of media to a post.
If the attachment fails with a 500 error, you need to check your settings.</p>
<p>Even after I ironed out the authentication issues with the application key I found media uploads were, understandably, slower than before and they sometimes timed out.
This was why I set the <code>keepalive_timeout</code> value to 60 rather than 30 in the nginx proxy settings and image uploads have not timed out since.</p>
<p>Though Mastodon will be uploading new media to the remote bucket and requesting it remotely, for preexisting media files it will look to the local <code>public/system</code> directory first.
This can make it harder to tell if the bucket setup is working or it&rsquo;s just the local storage doing the work, so if you&rsquo;re impatient you can get rid of that directory to force the instance to load everything from the bucket instead.
From <code>/home/mastodon/live/public</code> you can run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>mv system/ system_/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>to change the name of the <code>system</code> directory without immediately deleting everything in it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t simply leave <code>public/system</code> missing, though, if you want to keep the nginx proxy settings as they are.
Guess who found out the hard way this will crash the instance&hellip; :&rsquo;)
Instead, create a new empty <code>system</code> directory so the setting will have somewhere to look to and not throw an error.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>mkdir system
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the media still loads properly after this, and new media is fetched and uploaded, it means the setup is working.
Yay!</p>
<h2 id="cleanup-afterwork-and-thoughts">Cleanup, afterwork and thoughts</h2>
<p>You can let this setup run a few days to see whether it keeps working, doesn&rsquo;t overrun your traffic meters etc., before you empty out your local <code>public/system</code> directory, or delete <code>public/system_</code> if you did the directory switch I detailed above.
I can tell you it was quite a weight off to reclaim half my disk space from all that media.</p>
<p>I also ran some <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/tootctl/#accounts-refresh">accounts refresh</a> jobs because I had missing remote profile pics from emergency media deletions, back when my disk had overflowed and the database crashed.
Yeah, things were that bad.</p>
<p>Media loads correctly again on my instance, though there is an initial loading time, and I can get a proper media cache going without my disk at constant risk of running out.
Instance management has become enjoyable again without the constant risk of unplanned server downtime, and I am now able to consider putting other services on the server.</p>
<p>In the long term, media storage is something federated software and communities are going to have to figure out.
Services like <a href="https://jortage.com/">Jortage</a> look interesting, and something like it may be the future of media storage in the fediverse.
For now I have found a solution that works for my instance, and if this write-up helps others avoid some of my confusion and mistakes I will be happy&ndash;although, let&rsquo;s be real, these tech posts have mainly been helpful to myself for the purpose of record-keeping and documentation.</p>
<p>(Updated on 12/18/2023: Fixed a line break in the first line of the nginx configuration, added an advisory to clean up media before syncing.)</p>

<p>For instance, there was a gist stating that Mastodon could not directly interface with B2 for object storage because B2 was not S3-compatible, and MinIO would be needed as a relay. This was seemingly confirmed by documentation from Backblaze itself stating its S3 incompatibility. Turns out this was back in 2019-2020 and, as of late 2022, B2 is S3 compatible and MinIO no longer provides the relay function. Guess who only realized this after installing MinIO.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t write 50,000 words of a novel in a month for Camp NaNoWriMo in July of 2014, one of the alternate months of the National Novel Writing Month challenge.</p>
<p>I wrote 100,000 words.</p>
<p>Then I promptly flamed out and could barely write for months at a time, in a writing slump that lasted for years.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert, there&rsquo;s an eventual happy ending, or happy ongoing:
I came back from the burnout after some years and now have a stable writing routine, making progress on the story.
Still, boy was that experience a crash course, emphasis on &ldquo;crash,&rdquo; in what does and does not work for me.</p>
<h2 id="in-which-we-start-out-with-great-expectations">In which we start out with great expectations</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d been meaning for some time to work on the story idea I&rsquo;d been sporadically working on and researching for since around 2008.
I found the idea of National Novel-Writing Month attractive as a way of getting a first draft&ndash;no matter how shitty&ndash;in hand quickly.
Between grad school and a job, it was hard to get the time and energy to write and I thought forcing myself to write a Ridiculous Amount every day might be a way to do it.
You can probably glimpse the seeds of failure already in my line of thinking.</p>
<p>As I often do when I start something new, I read a whole book on the subject:
<em>No Plot? No Problem!</em> by the founder of NaNo himself.
I thought I had the idea down and liked the thought of getting words out in a gush from the subconscious, silencing the inner critic by making myself meet a word count threshold no matter what.</p>
<p>Already familiar with the technique from freewriting which I had used in journaling, I was ready to apply it to my first draft.
I also had an outline ready ahead of time, since I was used to writing by outline.</p>
<h2 id="in-which-our-hero-does-everything-right-or-so-she-thought">In which our hero does everything right, or so she thought</h2>
<p>Come July, I wrote every single day.
I wrote on subways and buses on commute; I wrote at home, I wrote riding on the exercise bike.
About 50,000 words into my original outline and with time left in the month, I decided the direction I was taking the story didn&rsquo;t work and outlined again.
The second outline was a bust, too, and so was the short-lived third outline.</p>
<p>Still, I kept writing no matter how crappy the output, trusting in the process and trying to soar on the wings of my subconscious through a maelstrom of terrible writing.
By the end of the month I had blown past the original 50,000-word goal and pushed out 100,000 words on three different drafts.
Progress, right?</p>
<p>Well&hellip; no.
Not in a straight line, anyway.
None of the drafts I had written ultimately worked, and I couldn&rsquo;t even bear to look back on them, not only because they were awful and no longer usable for my evolving conception of the story, but because they were associated with the memory of pushing myself to write beyond my own comfort.</p>
<p>My problems didn&rsquo;t stop with the unusable drafts: I also burned out on writing and couldn&rsquo;t work on the story for months.
I&rsquo;d work on it for a few days and then put it on hold for months, even over a year at a time, not helped by the continuing rush of school and work.
It would be a while and some life changes before I found a workable direction and a settled routine that let me make steady progress with the story.</p>
<h2 id="in-which-we-reflect-on-lessons-learned">In which we reflect on lessons learned</h2>
<p>Maybe NaNoWriMo did help me in the sense that I needed to run down those dead ends to get to where I am in the story, and NaNo let me get the trial-and-error out of the way on fast forward.
Even more valuable, though, was that I learned about my own process as a writer, both what works and doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>First, the freewriting-style &ldquo;let your subconscious take over&rdquo; school of writing does not work for me when writing fiction.
I&rsquo;d gotten some mileage out of it for journaling, as discussed, but it&rsquo;s just not how I work on story drafts, even first drafts.
I certainly don&rsquo;t need or want a perfect, or even good, first draft, but I do need to put some thought into making things at least coherent if I want to make the draft a meaningful basis for future work.</p>
<p>Second, for me, forcing a large word count is a recipe for burnout.
It&rsquo;s too painful, and ultimately unsustainable.
I&rsquo;m very much a &ldquo;slow and steady&rdquo; kind of writer, and in a way I owe that self-knowledge to NaNo.
Live and learn, though the lesson may be painful.</p>
<p>Third, my experience with NaNo may also have been when I started to let go of the fantasy of having it all, and realized I couldn&rsquo;t fill up all my time with work and then somehow cram writing in there as well.
I would have to make room in my life for a writing practice, and that would entail real life changes, scary as they were.
There were no shortcuts.
I had to put in the time, effort, and commitment.
Actually acting on this realization would take more time and effort, and is a story for another time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-don-t-look-back-in-anger">Conclusion: Don&rsquo;t look back in anger</h2>
<p>NaNo might not have worked for me and I will never do it in its full form again, but I learned from it and I wish good luck and good fun to the many thousands of writers who will be undertaking the challenge this coming November and afterward.
I&rsquo;ll be cheering from the sidelines, continuing in my own way and at my own pace.</p>

      <title>The Heroine of the Game Carto Is Nonspeaking (and It&#39;s Totally Cool)</title>
      <link>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/carto-game-nonspeaking/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2022 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate>

      <description>The heroine of the indie game Carto is a nonspeaking girl, and it&amp;rsquo;s neither tragic nor remarkable.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a lot of fun playing the indie game <em>Carto</em> (2020), an innovative and enjoyable puzzle game where you put map pieces together, changing in-game reality itself to overcome obstacles and help reunite our heroine Carto and her grandmother.
I don&rsquo;t think I could add much to what has already been said about its gameplay and narrative, and there&rsquo;s a good selection of reviews linked from the game&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/carto">Metacritic page</a>.</p>
<p>What I haven&rsquo;t seen discussed as much is that the titular protagonist Carto appears to be a nonspeaking person, or one who only occasionally speaks.
Though reviews like <a href="https://worthplaying.com/article/2021/3/5/reviews/124568-switch-review-carto/">this one</a> or <a href="https://cogconnected.com/review/carto-review/">this one</a> alluded to her silence, they generally put it down to her being quiet or shy.
Carto may be quiet, but shy? Nah.
There&rsquo;s no reason to discount neurodivergence as an explanation and here&rsquo;s my case for it.</p>
<p><strong>SPOILER WARNING:</strong> The rest of this post contains spoilers about the world and story of the game <em>Carto.</em></p>
<h2 id="a-smile-is-worth-a-thousand-words">A smile is worth a thousand words :-)</h2>
<p>From the first I found it slightly odd that Carto&rsquo;s &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo; was represented by emojis, most commonly the smile emoji :-) accompanied by her sprite representation smiling.
Every other character&rsquo;s lines were represented by actual words, after all.
She also did not seem to be deaf, since she understood when other characters addressed her in spoken language.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ljwrites.blog/img/carto/carto-smile.png"
         alt="Carto, a young girl in white with chin-length dark hair, smiles at a man in glasses. There is a smile emoji :-) representing a smiling face turned sideways in her speech bubble."/> 
</figure>

<p>I was excited at the thought that Carto might be hearing but nonspeaking, since my son is mostly nonspeaking and I&rsquo;m always thrilled at good autistic representation in media.
Still, I thought the emojis could be an abstraction of Carto&rsquo;s lines rather than a literal depiction so I didn&rsquo;t get my hopes up too much.
There was so much else to enjoy about the game, after all.</p>
<p>Undoubted confirmation came toward the end of the game, like a gift.
When Carto finally meets up with her grandmother, her best friend Shianan jokes about not hearing much about the grandmother because Carto is so quiet.</p>
<p>It looks like Shianan could have heard a lot about Grandma if she&rsquo;d had time to learn sign language, though, because Grandma&rsquo;s last letter prior to the meeting has a sketch of her and Carto signing to each other.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ljwrites.blog/img/carto/carto-sign.jpg"
         alt="Part of a letter reading &#39;I can&#39;t wait to hold you in my arms. We have so much to explore together! Love, Granny,&#39; with a sketch of a larger hand and a smaller one making a sign with thumb and pinkie extended and the other fingers curled."/> 
</figure>

<p>Carto also speaks a little toward the end, mostly names&ndash;&ldquo;Grandma!&rdquo; &ldquo;Carto and Shianan!&rdquo; and so on, showing that her earlier emoji-talk was not an abstraction but actual representations of facial expressions without spoken words.</p>
<p>So there you have it, Carto is a hearing and nonspeaking or minimally speaking character who speaks primarily in sign language.
She seems to have little trouble with verbal comprehension or writing, the latter seen in a letter she sends Shianan in the epilogue.</p>
<p>It was such a rare case of a nonspeaking character, the main character at that, shown in a way that&rsquo;s not left open for interpretation or headcanons but made explicitly clear as canon.
It&rsquo;s hard to express the depth of my appreciation for this, except maybe by writing a giant review and shoutout post on that one subject I guess.</p>
<h2 id="no-big-deal-because-it-isn-t">No big deal, because it isn&rsquo;t</h2>
<p>Something else I found refreshing is that Carto&rsquo;s being nonspeaking is no big deal at all to the other characters.
Shianan mentions it once, as discussed above, in a gently teasing/apologetic way after she and Carto have become good friends.
Otherwise, the characters Carto comes across don&rsquo;t bring it up, interacting without making a fuss when Carto communicates nonverbally, such as by signing or showing &ldquo;sand&rdquo; to them when she wants directions to the desert.</p>
<p>One moment of respectful but casual accommodation that comes to mind is when Carto was at the volcano hotel<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> rebooting their water heating system.
The machinery is accessible by climbing a rope down a pit, and one of the hotel&rsquo;s proprietors remains at the top while Carto climbs down.
When Carto reaches the boiler room at the bottom, the proprietor calls out to her to pull on the rope when she wants to climb back up.</p>
<p>This left an impression because the two characters are never out of shouting distance from each other, and the proprietor guides Carto through the ultimately disastrous reboot sequence by vocal instruction.
The proprietor, in other words, noticed Carto doesn&rsquo;t speak and made no comment about it, but opted to give her the instruction to pull on the rope rather than shout, accommodating the lack of vocal communication.</p>
<p>In a better world this is how all accommodation would happen, respectfully and with minimal comment.
In an even better world hotel proprietors would also not send guests into dangerous locations to do their repair work.
But we can&rsquo;t have everything now, can we?</p>
<p>Maybe one reason the characters find Carto&rsquo;s neurodivergence entirely unremarkable is that the world of the game is itself diverse, with many different ways of life coexisting.
Carto&rsquo;s own clan fly all around the world on blimps.
We start her in-game adventures on an island where no one comes back home after leaving as a teenager.
Later we move on to a forest where people grow huge beards, have animal companions, and one chosen person guards a giant growing tree for decades, away from human settlements.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop a girl who doesn&rsquo;t speak is positively ordinary, and whether the reasons are neurological, cultural, or otherwise it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be considered anyone else&rsquo;s business.
Is she physically or neurologically unable to speak?
Does she not speak the local language?
Did she take a vow of silence?
Who knows, and what does it matter?</p>
<p>Cultural diversity leading to neurodivergence acceptance makes sense to me because neurotype normativity is just one of the many pressures for conformity that form the basis of bigotry in our world.
This kind of coexistence between vastly different peoples is a fascinating aspect of Carto&rsquo;s world.</p>
<h2 id="i-guess-there-should-be-a-conclusion">I guess there should be a conclusion</h2>
<p>Carto is a great little game that puzzle game lovers are likely to enjoy, one with a straightforward and entertaining story.
It may also enhance your enjoyment that the hero of the game is a nonspeaking and, to my mind, autistic girl who enjoys full respect from the people around her, who is at no point seen as an aberration or tragedy.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I highly recommend the game.
It&rsquo;s fun and a little different, like Carto herself.</p>

      <title>Resolving Arch Linux 404 and Dependency Errors</title>
      <link>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/arch-linux-404-dependency/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/arch-linux-404-dependency/</guid>
      <description>Update the package database and manually resolve dependencies.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Arch Linux user!</p>
<p>Do you keep getting 404 errors when you try to install packages?
Did you rewrite your <code>/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</code> file for what feels like dozens of times?
Did you edit your <code>/etc/pacman.conf</code> file according to this Stack Exchange and forum post or that, hoping to get things to work?</p>
<p>If so, these tips just might help.
That&rsquo;s where I was, to the point of almost ragequitting Arch altogether, but trying these tips helped.</p>
<h2 id="update-the-package-database">Update the package database</h2>
<p>If you have your <code>mirrorlist</code> file arranged so the ones geographically closer to you are on top, it may be that you need to update your database.
You might want to try updating your package database with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ sudo pacman -Sy
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Or you could do a full system upgrade with <code>-Syu</code>, your choice.
This landed me in dependency hell, though, see below, so I opted for just a database update this time around and it worked for me.</p>
<p>The reason 404 errors are common in Arch, according to a forum post I saw, is that old packages are deleted on the servers.
Therefore, if your package database is outdated <code>pacman</code> will ask for old deleted versions of packages, resulting in 404 errors.</p>
<p>Live and learn, right?</p>
<h2 id="the-next-level-dependency-hell">The next level: Dependency hell</h2>
<p>After updating the database Arch finally seemed ready to start installing packages again, but this time I fell into the dread&hellip; dependency hell.
It consisted of messages like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>:: poppler<span style="color:#f92672">(</span>21.07.0-1<span style="color:#f92672">)</span> 설치로 의존성 <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;poppler=21.06.1&#39;</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>poppler-glib가 요구<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>가 깨집니다
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Which, translated into English, means that the package I was trying to install (kdenlive) required I upgrade <code>poppler</code> to version 21.07.0-1, which would break the dependency of <code>poppler-glib</code> on version 21.06.1.
Evidenly this would ultimately lead to a dependency breakage of Gnu Image Manipulation Program via <code>gegl</code>&rsquo;s dependency on that specific version of <code>poppler-glib</code>.</p>
<p>Running the install command with <code>--ignore poppler</code> didn&rsquo;t help, since pacman refused to install without the poppler upgrade.
Nor did trying to install with <code>sudo pacman -Sdd kdenlive</code> help, since this resulted in kdenlive installing without any dependencies and the package simply did not work.</p>
<p>So what I did was upgrade the offending dependency by itself, which was feasible in my case because there was just one, specifying a <code>-d</code> switch so the dependency version check was ignored:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ sudo pacman -Sd poppler
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When I tried the kdenlive installation again it worked, and luckily the Image Manipulation Program wasn&rsquo;t broken by the poppler upgrade.
It very well could have been, though, since upgrades to dependencies do cause breakages.
That&rsquo;s why dependency version checks exist in the first place.</p>
<p>By ignoring dependency version checks, therefore, you do assume the risk of dependency breakages causing malfunctions, which is a long-running issue in the open source world.
Arch Linux, in particular, only allows one version of each package, raising the risk of dependency breakages&ndash;not a good combination with its fast-moving updates.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that running the kdenlive install with one <code>-d</code> switch instead of two might have had a similar result as installing the dependency package with <code>-d</code>, maybe in conjunction with <code>--ignore poppler</code>.
According to <code>man pacman</code> one <code>-d</code> switch just ignores dependency version checks while repeating it twice like I did ignores all dependencies, which in this case meant the app wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<h2 id="keep-arching-on-dot-dot-dot-or-not">Keep Arching on&hellip; or not</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t claim these tips will solve every problem with the Arch package manager, but they could be helpful if your mirrorlist seems more or less in order yet all mirrors are failing with 404 errors.
And if dependency conflicts are tying up your package installations and system updates after the 404 errors are resolved, the second part of the advice would come into play.
If you don&rsquo;t want the risk of broken dependencies, or if ignoring dependencies result in apps breaking, you should file a bug report with the relevant projects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a valid choice to decide that maybe Arch Linux isn&rsquo;t for you if you find these issues to be too much trouble.
Arch is a purposefully fast-moving distribution and by design requires a level of expertise or at least bloody-mindedness.
There are user-friendlier Arch-based distributions like Manjaro that stay a little behind the development curve and are said to be more stable as a result.
The price is in staler packages than mainline Arch, but it&rsquo;s my understanding packages are still newer than in something like Debian.
Besides, truly cutting-edge users don&rsquo;t find even Arch packages new enough and turn to the Arch User Repository for development versions or compile directly from project Git repos.</p>
<p>In the end you have to decide how important newer packages and upgrades are to you, and how much hassle you&rsquo;re willing to put up with.
If you want to keep going with Arch Linux, hopefully this post is helpful to you.</p>
