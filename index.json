[{"content":"This post is a compilation and summary of accounts from premodern Korea, defined here as largely pre-20th century, recording homosexual, gender-ambiguous/non-conforming, and otherwise queer experiences. It will begin with a summation of premodern Korean terms on homosexuality, then discuss specific accounts of homosexuality, bisexuality, and gender nonconformity that we might today read as queer or LGBTQA, including the context of times and life history where available. Classist bias is heavy in the historical record and many of the detailed personal contexts tend to be available for members of the ruling class such as kings, but contexts for other individual personages or classes of persons can be gleaned through the terminology used, descriptions of social customs, and the rare instances where same-gender love between working-class people, primarily of women, touched on the perceived dignity and rights of men in the ruling classes.\nI am greatly indebted in the preparation of this write-up to Professor Kang Moon-jong\u0026rsquo;s Studies on the traditional era homosexuality, published in the journal Yeongju Eomun Vol. 30 (June 2015), especially for alerting me to the existence of Yi Gyubo\u0026rsquo;s Poem Prompted by the 50 Verses Sent by Enlightened Gongong to young Master Bak and some of the events and writings from the Joseon era. The section on terminology also follows both the format of his paper and draws directly from his summation of the terms, with some modifications and additions. Where I was unable to independently confirm a primary or secondary source cited by Professor Kang but rather rely on the paper itself, I have cited it as \u0026ldquo;Kang (2015)\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;via Kang (2015).\u0026rdquo;\nContent warnings for this write-up include sexual violence, age gap/possible underage relationships, corporeal punishment and other violence against queer people, general political violence including murder, death from coerced labor, cisnormativity, sexism/patriarchy, etc.\nPremodern Korean terminology on homosexuality The most common word for homosexuality in premodern Korea was daeshik 對食 (\u0026ldquo;eat together\u0026rdquo;). Originating from the Han Dynasty of China, this referred to palace servants including maids and eunuchs entering into marriage-like committed relationships with each other. In premodern Korea the word came to mean homosexuality in general between men and women alike, though its original meaning of love in the specific setting of court was also preserved. A related though rarer and more limited term is gyobung 交朋 (\u0026ldquo;making friends\u0026rdquo;), a term that is listed to this day in the dictionary as a traditional term for female homosexuality, though it has faded from everyday use.\nOther common terms included namchong 男寵 (\u0026ldquo;favor of men\u0026rdquo;) and the related one of namsaek 男色 (\u0026ldquo;sex with men\u0026rdquo;), which referred exclusively to male homosexuality.1 Yongyang 龍陽 (\u0026ldquo;dragon sunlight\u0026rdquo;) was a related term referring to the title given to a king\u0026rsquo;s favored male lover from the ancient Wei Dynasty of China, and can be seen especially in the History of Goryeo regarding favors given by kings to male lovers.\nThere are also terms relating to rape of men by men, gyegan 鷄姦 (\u0026ldquo;chicken fornication?\u0026rdquo;), also of Chinese origin. Other terms relating to this crime that has seen some use in premodern Korea are bukchung 北衝 (\u0026ldquo;northern/hind stabbing\u0026rdquo;) and namgan 男奸 (\u0026ldquo;male fornication\u0026rdquo;) which seem to refer primarily to anal rape.\nThere are also the Korean terms biyeokjil 비역질 for sex between men and baendaejil 밴대질 for sex between women, but the latter is of uncertain origin and there is no existing premodern record using the term.\nOverall, then, the leading terms for homosexuality in premodern Korean societies include daeshik (women and men), namchong (men), namsaek (men), biyeokjil (men), and in some specific circumstances, yongyang for men in court. These terms show widespread awareness of homosexual activity in premodern Korea, with differentiation for specific social contexts.\nSources: Kang (2015), Naver Dictionary entry on gyobung, various History of Goryeo articles (see sections on the kings of Goryeo)\nKing Hyegong of Shilla (8th century): A woman born in a man\u0026rsquo;s body The reign of King Hyegong, the 36th king of the ancient Korean kingdom of Shilla, was marked by strife and chaos ever since taking the throne at the age of eight, with power struggles and rebellions compounded by catastrophic natural disasters. The king was eventually slain in the political turmoil, and the end of this monarch\u0026rsquo;s reign marks the close of the Middle Period of Shilla and the start of its Final Period.\nIt is said that King Gyeongdeok, Hyegong\u0026rsquo;s father, badly wanted a son, having set aside his first queen for the lack of a son and wedded a second queen. The story goes that King Gyeongdeok asked a spiritual man, Pyohun, to petition the Jade Emperor in Heaven for a royal son. Pyohun, after meeting with the Jade Emperor, gave word from on high that there was a daughter for the king but no son. King Gyeongdeok, persistent in his goal, asked that the daughter be exchanged for a son. The Jade Emperor warned that it was possible, but the change would endanger the kingdom. Gyeongdeok was unwavering, and indeed his wife gave birth to a male-assigned baby.\nIt was said that the future King Hyegong\u0026rsquo;s unnatural birth that switched a girl into a boy caused disturbing portents, with intense thunder and lightning storms and 16 Buddhist temples being struck by lightning. The young prince enjoyed girls\u0026rsquo; amusements and adornments from a young age, causing people to comment on the child\u0026rsquo;s lack of fitness as a future king. Some say the allegations of the prince\u0026rsquo;s birth and femininity are a commentary on King Hyegong\u0026rsquo;s ineffectual reign.\nKing Hyegong, along with regent and mother Queen Dowager Manwol, made many attempts from early in the young king\u0026rsquo;s reign to reinforce the failing power of the monarchy, including reforms to ancestral rites and inspecting the regions. However, it was not enough to turn the tides of the increasing disorder from the father King Gyeongdeok\u0026rsquo;s time. Hyegong was said to be a soft and undisciplined king who was enamored of music and women, and was ultimately slain by high-ranking nobility at the age of 22.\nSource: HistoryNet entry\nKing Mokjong of Goryeo (10th century): The childless king with a known male lover The seventh king of the medieval Korean kingdom of Goryeo and son of Gyeongjong the fifth king, Mokjong was known for his talent from a young age and for wise and beneficient policies a king, such as diplomatic efforts that promoted peace and establishment of bureaucratic and military systems for the still-new kingdom. His reign, however, was marred by his failure to control the arbitrary abuses of power by his mother Queen Dowager Heonae. In the end the confusion caused by the Queen Dowager\u0026rsquo;s attempts to take power with her lover Kim Chi-yang led to a rebellion, and Mokjong was assassinated at the age of 28.\nMokjong had a queen and a concubine but was known to be uninterested in women and had no children, something that he expressed concern for. He named his nephew (the son of his mother\u0026rsquo;s late sister) First Prince Daeryang as his heir, and Prince Daeryang went on to be King Hyeonjong after him.\nMokjong had a lover, Yu Haeng-gan, a beautiful man who gained the king\u0026rsquo;s favor and rose to high office on that basis in a relationship referred to as yongyang. Yu Haeng-gan was said to be a power-hungry and arrogant man of little ability or wisdom who leaned on the king\u0026rsquo;s favor to exercise power and prestige beyond his station and talents. Yu Haeng-gan was opposed to Mokjong making Prince Daeryang the royal heir, so much that Mokjong made the preparations a secret from his lover. There is speculation that Yu Chungjeong, another man that Yu Haeng-gan introduced to the king, was also a royal lover, but unlike with Yu Haeng-gan there is no direct record of a sexual relationship between Mokjong and Yu Chungjeong. Yu Haeng-gan was also killed during the rebellion that ended Mokjong\u0026rsquo;s reign, while there is no record of Yu Chungjeong\u0026rsquo;s death though he was recorded as being by Mokjong\u0026rsquo;s side when the king was expelled from the palace prior to his death.\nSources: Encyclopedia of Korean Culture entry, Mokjong\u0026rsquo;s entries in the History of Goryeo, Yu Haeng-gan\u0026rsquo;s entry in the book of lowly flatterers\nGonggong the Enlightened (13th century): The monk unmoved by feminine temptations falls for a lovely youth Gonggong 空空 was the name taken by Great Yuga Master Gyeongjo, who was a monk in the Yuga tradition of Buddhism (originating from an order of monks who cultivated yoga practice) and rose to the rank of Threefold Great Master. A free spirit who loved the companionship of boys, he was also known as the Poet Monk for his aptitude with verse and the King of Dharma for his deep knowledge of Buddhist doctrine. His fame reached as far as Song in China, and he was gifted a staff, lacquered begging bowls, and prayer beads along with a poem by an esteemed monk. He was friends with fellow literary talents of his day, and some of his religious poetry survives today.\nThe story of the love between Gonggong and a bright young man with the surname Bak is told in verse by Gonggong\u0026rsquo;s friend Yi Gyubo, a celebrated poet and essayist in 12th and 13th century Korea. Yi Gyubo wrote the poem, 次韻空空上人贈朴少年五十韻 (Poem Prompted by the 50 Verses Sent by Enlightened Gongong to young Master Bak), in response to verse written by Gonggong for his young lover. The original that Yi was responding to did not survive, but this reply poem is clear enough on the nature of the relationship.\nAfter an opening that discusses the yin and yang principles of the universe and the crucial role of marriage and romantic love, Yi discusses his friend Gonggong\u0026rsquo;s indifference to women:\n孰有相逢花態度\nRegardless what the sweetness met\nin bloom of womanhood\n終然得固鐵肝腸\nHis heart shall be as hardest steel\nunto the bitter end.\nInstead, Yi says, Gonggong chose a simple life in spiritual retreat:\n岩扉寂寞真堪樂\nThough little gate is silent, this\naustere retreat is joy\n世路繁華豈所望\nWhy at the bustle of the world\nwouldst spare a single glance?\nYet one man, the young Master Bak, captures the great spiritual master\u0026rsquo;s heart:\n未知朴子形何似\nI know not how this Master Bak\nis shaped or how he looks\n坐使空師意反狂\nTo drive the meditating Gong\nto madness in restraint\nYi vividly describes the feelings induced by this young man in his esteemed friend:\n自說純陽何感應\nTo claim pure Yang as virgin male\nbut cold a comfort lends\n但憐奇表最清揚\nThe boast of purest outward mien\nmere pity does command.\n亮非走野風牛突\nBelike a bull that\u0026rsquo;s penned away\nfrom field and wind will kick\n又豈奔泉渴鹿忙\nAnd would a thirsty stag forget\ntoward a brook to bound?\nThe emotional intimacy and longing as well as the strong desire in the relationship are made clear in the poem:\n但將款密期為友\nThe deepest intimacy is\ntrue friendship\u0026rsquo;s only path\n何忍須臾不共堂\nHow could they merest moment\u0026rsquo;s part-\ning ever countenance?\n別去尋思如隔地\nApart and deep in thought, \u0026rsquo;tis like\nthe earth were stoppered up\n訪來方抃況麾牆\nA visit met with claps, and is\nthat waving from the fence?\n及當軒翥翔千里\nWhen stepping in the house he could\nfly all a thousand leagues\n得可從容宿一房\nAll just to reach that single room\nand sleep in peaceful calm.\nThe qualities of the young man Bak are praised in the poem as well, as a fitting match for the learned and accomplished Gonggong:\n矧此少年生早慧\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s more, this boy despite his youth\ncame early to be wise\n尤於博學飽曾嘗\nAnd breadth of learning made him in\nhis studies a gourmand.\n宛如濯濯春林色\nHis clean and shining light is like\nthe sprouting green of spring\n正似團團望月光\nThe rounded brilliance just like\nthe full moon at a glance.\nThe poem is unambiguous about the nature of the relationship, that there were not only emotional and intellectual but also sexual exchange as well. The term daeshik, with the explicit reference to the Book of Han, leaves no question that this was a male homosexual relationship, given its usage in Korea and given that neither man was a maidservant or eunuch.\n寢底同衾情苟篤\nIn single bedding they embrace\nin rest and love profound\n宮中對食效奚妨\nWho could their emulation of\nthe courtly love infringe?

Born after Goryeo\u0026rsquo;s capitulation to the Mongol Chinese Empire of Yuan, Chungseon was the product of his father Chungryeol\u0026rsquo;s strategic marriage to a Mongol princess to strengthen the royal family. Chungseon himself would go on to marry a Mongol Princess, Princess Supreme Gyeguk, Borjigin Budashiri great-granddaughter of Kubilai Khan.\nDespite these efforts, King Chungseon\u0026rsquo;s reign was never stable. He was ousted and called to the Yuan court in favor of his father Chungryeol a mere eight months into his reign, and returned to the throne in Goryeo after Chungryeol\u0026rsquo;s death. This kind of instability would be a feature of Goryeo kingship during the period of Yuan interference, intensified by the ties of blood and marriage. Only three months into his return as Goryeo\u0026rsquo;s king he went back to the the Yuan court where he ruled from afar despite repeated requests from Goryeo to return, and would exercise heavy influence even after passing the throne onto his son King Chungsuk. An active player in the Yuan Imperial Court, a collector of books and a promoter of scholarly exchange between Yuan and Goryeo, Chungseon was awarded princehood by Külüg Khan after helping the latter come to power, and was also exiled to Tibet in his later years during power struggles in the court before he returned and died in Yuan at the age of 50.\nChungseon had six queen consorts, ranging from his chief consort Princess Gyeguk, his second queen who was a Mongol woman not from the Imperial family, and four ethnic Korean queens. He also had sexual relations with unnamed female servants, two of whom he is on record as gifting to his followers. One of his mistresses was formerly his father Chungryeol\u0026rsquo;s Royal Concubine Sukchang from the house of Kim. Lady Kim was said to have been vain and extravagant, intervening in affairs of state and throwing a party during the mourning period for her own mother.\nIn addition to having many women Chungseon is described as \u0026ldquo;greatly enjoying male love (多愛男色)\u0026rdquo; and his favors, using the phrase the favors of yongyang (龍陽之寵), were given to Won Chung, a young man of no particular personal distinction from a high-ranking family. Won Chung was called at age 18 by Chungseon to office greeting guests and managing the household. At this point Chungseon was a prince-in-exile residing in Dàdū (modern-day Beijing), ousted from the Goryeo throne and in between his two reigns as King, though he was now in high favor with the Yuan court and would shortly be returning for his second reign. Chungseon\u0026rsquo;s favor was such that he gave Won Chung the royal surname of Wang and changed his name to Wang Ju.\nHowever when Chungseon, two years into his return as King of Goryeo, tried to award Won Chung/Wang Ju even higher office, the man demurred saying he was neither experienced nor capable enough (he was not yet 20 at this time). Angered, Chungseon took Won Chung\u0026rsquo;s royal name away and demoted him. The two men reconciled later on when Won Chung greeted Chungseon on his return from Yuan, coming all the way out to Goryeo\u0026rsquo;s northern frontier of the Amnok River to meet him and treating him with care and courtesy the same as ever. He eventually rose to the high office he had refused earlier and had the king\u0026rsquo;s trust.\nWhen Chungseon spoke to his son Chungsuk about Won Chung it was with praise, saying the man had served the royal family through generations and had ties through marriage, making him incomparable to other vassals. Chungseon also told Won Chung to serve the king with loyalty forever. Won Chung would go on to serve Chungseon\u0026rsquo;s son Chungsuk and grandson Chunghye, rising to high office and going on diplomatic missions. He was said to be restrained and diligent, taciturn, and a good administrator though he had little learning, and had three sons.\nSources: Encyclopedia of Korean Culture entry, Yi Neung-gan\u0026rsquo;s entry in Biographies of Vassals, Royal Concubine Sukchang\u0026rsquo;s Encyclopedia of Korea Culture entry, Won Chung\u0026rsquo;s Encyclopedia of Korean Culture entry, Won Chung\u0026rsquo;s entry in Biographies of Vassals, entry in the Compact History of Goryeo about Won Chung turning down high office\nKing Gongmin of Goryeo (14th century): No woman but his wife, crossdressing, male lovers The 31st King of Goryeo, he was a grandson of King Chungseon and functionally the last recognized king of Goryeo. It should be noted that many scholars express skepticism on the accuracy of accounts on King Gongmin; the legitimacy of his heirs, or lack thereof, had a direct impact on that of the next dynasty, Joseon, which was when the History of Goryeo was compiled. Nevertheless, there is no indication that these records were manufactured out of whole cloth, though readers should certainly be aware of biases from political agendas. The necessity for such caution arguably holds true for all historical records.\nGongmin is widely known and admired in Korean history for breaking Goryeo away from the Yuan Empire\u0026rsquo;s interference as Yuan\u0026rsquo;s power waned. He took back territory conquered by Yuan, and ceased the use of the Mongol empire\u0026rsquo;s calendar and customs. Internally, he purged pro-Yuan elements in court and resettled the balance of power by weakening the political control of the military leadership and nurturing a new generation of Confucian scholar-bureaucrats. The latter, ironically, would be some of the main forces behind the founding of Joseon which would replace Goryeo.\nThe fall of Yuan and the turmoil in the Goryeo power structure, however, caused external and internal chaos that undermined any attempts to rule. He had to flee the palace when hundreds of thousands of Red Turban rebels who had rose up against Yuan invaded Goryeo. He survived internal rebellions and assassination attempts, and the purges and punishments he handed down as he grew increasingly suspicious only isolated him farther.\nThe queen who supported him unconditionally throughout his anti-Yuan independence policy and internal turmoil was the Mongol Princess Supreme Noguk of Yuan, born Borjigin Budashiri. Like every king in his line since his great-grandfather Chungryeol he wedded a Yuan Princess for political backing, but the history is very clear that King Gongmin and his wife were deeply in love\u0026mdash;and the historians were not always approving about it. Their love is the stuff of legend in Korean history, such as the time the Princess Supreme sat before the doors to her husband\u0026rsquo;s room to protect him from rebel assassins, a courage praised down the ages well into the Joseon era. There is also a charming anecdote that Gongmin, an artist who disliked horseback riding and was the only king of Goryeo who did not hunt, practiced riding with the Princess at her behest during their displacement from court.\nThe fatal flaw in their love from a patriarchal perspective was Princess Noguk\u0026rsquo;s infertility. This couple had no children 15 years into their marriage, which was a source of instability and concern for the dynasty. By itself this bad luck could generally be remedied by royal polygamy, but according to the History of Goryeo he never much enjoyed intimacy with women and his visits to Princess Noguk were very rare. The Princess reluctantly and sorrowfully acquiesced to the king marrying a second queen 10 years into the childless marriage, but it appears he was not intimate with the other lady at all.\nWhen the Princess finally fell pregnant with the couple\u0026rsquo;s long-awaited child, such was Gongmin\u0026rsquo;s desire for a safe birth that he pardoned prisoners and had temples and shrines across the kingdom pray for her. Unfortunately she died during a difficult birth, and the baby died with her. It was a catastrophe in an already unstable reign, often seen as the beginning of the end for the king both personally and politically.\nThe loss of a strong political backing from his marriage to the Princess led Gongmin to take drastic measures to carry on his reforms, the foremost of which was appointing Shin Don, a former monk with no noble background or bureaucratic qualification, to head those reforms. Shin Don is called both a bold reformer who put brakes on the nobility\u0026rsquo;s abuse of power and mistreatment of the people, and an illegitimate despot who himself abused the power given to him by an increasingly unstable king. It was Gongmin himself who eventually turned on Shin Don by arresting and executing him on charges of treachery against the throne, and the reforms ultimately failed.\nAccording to the framing of the History of Goryeo, which as seen in the caveat above may be biased for the political agenda of justifying the next dynasty, Gongmin\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;excessive\u0026rdquo; grief for his beloved queen also contributed to the fall of his kingdom. He started wasteful construction projects for her shrine, the size of which was an enormous drain on the already embattled kingdom\u0026rsquo;s resources. The work itself caused the deaths of workers and suffering for the populace from the literally monumental effort to carry the materials from afar and build the edifice. He would take meals in front of her portrait, speaking to her as though to a living wife, and his continued refusal to be intimate with his other wives meant he had no heir. When asked by his mother eight years after the Princess\u0026rsquo;s death why he did not frequent his queen consorts\u0026rsquo; chambers, he replied weeping that there were none like the Princess, which his mother reprimanded as shameful and excessive grief.\nAccording to the records he was not, however, adverse to intimacy with men. The History of Goryeo records King Gongmin gathering young men from good families around him as his personal bodyguard, the Jajewi, on whom he bestowed numerous favors. Some see this as analogous to the decade Gongmin himself spent as a young prince at Yuan court as an imperial bodyguard and hostage. He also had a male lover, Kim Heung-gyeong, who received the king\u0026rsquo;s yongyang favor and high office. He was also placed in charge of the Jajewi.\nThe History of Goryeo records the Jajewi doing \u0026ldquo;wanton and filthy\u0026rdquo; deeds for the king\u0026rsquo;s favor, which included sex with the king but was not described in the refined language of yongyang or even namsaek, perhaps because the sex acts with the men in question were not considered befitting a high-ranking man\u0026rsquo;s dignity. This allegedly consisted of the king putting on women\u0026rsquo;s cosmetics, ordering the young men of the Jajewi to have sex with a young servant girl while he watched from the next room, and then having the men do \u0026ldquo;wanton deeds unto him as to a woman.\u0026rdquo; This seems to imply being a recipient of penetration (i.e. a bottom), considered in many cultures to be shameful and submissive for a man of dominant status where being the penetrator of a man was acceptable.\nAccording to the record, Gongmin also planned to resolve the problem of begetting an heir by having these young bodyguards to rape his queens, something the ladies resisted threatening suicide but one of them relented when Gongmin threatened her at swordpoint. These actions became the king\u0026rsquo;s downfall when she fell pregnant from the rapes by Hong Ryun, a leading member of the Jajewi. Gongmin, on being told by a eunuch Choi Mansaeng about the pregnancy, announced that he would have Hong Ryun killed\u0026mdash;and then, inexplicably, told Choi Mansaeng that he would be killed as well for knowing this. Somewhat unsurprisingly, Choi Mansaeng and Hong Ryun later burst into Gongmin\u0026rsquo;s bedchamber where the king was in drunken slumber and stabbed him to death.\nThough Gongmin did have a son, or said he did, there were so many doubts cast on the boy\u0026rsquo;s birth that he never gained legitimacy and was ultimately executed by the rising coalition of soldiers and scholars who would ultimately bring down Goryeo and found the new kingdom of Joseon. Gongmin never mentioned the boy until a few years after his birth, claiming he had made a royal visit to the late Shin Don\u0026rsquo;s home where he lay with a female servant of Shin Don, Banya, who later gave birth to a boy. After Shin Don\u0026rsquo;s execution Gongmin brought the boy to the palace to be raised as a prince and be his heir, but even taking his story at face value the boy Wu had no right to be the king\u0026rsquo;s heir because he was born outside recognized marriage or concubinage. As it were, many doubted Wu\u0026rsquo;s paternity and both Wu and his son Chang were later executed, and were called Shin Wu and Shin Chang as descendants of Shin Don rather than the royal surname of Wang.\nThough we might not be able to take all of the History of Goryeo at face value especially at the end of the dynasty, by the History\u0026rsquo;s framing King Gongmin\u0026rsquo;s favors and immoral acts with men, together with an aversion to physical intimacy with women, perhaps compounded by what was viewed as an unusual and shameful level of affection for an infertile\u0026mdash;and later dead\u0026mdash;queen, contributed to the instability and fall of his kingdom. It should be noted that a king having male lovers was not in itself problematic or unusual in the eyes of the history writers, but rather the shameful nature of some of these sexual acts together with the attempt to adulterate the royal line through cuckoldry.\nSources: Encyclopedia of Korean Culture entry, Princess Supreme Noguk\u0026rsquo;s Encyclopedia of Korean Culture entry, King Gongmin\u0026rsquo;s section of the History of Goryeo, History of Goryeo description of the Jajewi\u0026rsquo;s sexual misdeeds, History of Goryeo describing Kim Heung-gyeong as the king\u0026rsquo;s lover\nSossang and Danji (15th century): Enslaved women in a known sexual relationship Sossang and Danji were servants in the palace of the Joseon dynasty in its early years. Sossang was a servant of the palace, meaning she was indentured to the state, while Danji was a private servant in the household of one of the Crown Prince\u0026rsquo;s royal concubines.\nAccording to the record, Sossang and Danji were in love and sometimes slept together, leaving no doubt that the relationship was sexual in nature. The Crown Princess Consort at the time from the house of Bong, when later interrogated by her father-in-law the king, described how Sossang and Danji not only slept together at night but also embraced neck to neck and sucked each others\u0026rsquo; tongues because they were \u0026ldquo;always loving and joyful (常時愛好)\u0026rdquo; with each other, in what may be the only surviving description of consenting erotic activity between women from premodern Korea. Neither Sossang nor Danji had full freedom to marry of their own volition as enslaved persons, though enslavers might give their blessings or at least tolerate male-female unions involving the persons they had enslaved. Nevertheless, it seemed these two had some space to have a relationship with each other which, if technically illegitimate, was at least a known phenomenon and one that was not particularly more stringently punished than male-female adultery, as discussed below.\nSuch female homosexual relationships and the women in them were almost never recorded, and the reason we know these two particular women\u0026rsquo;s names and their relationship is because the aforementioned Crown Princess Consort Bong developed a sexual interest in Sossang and, per Sossang\u0026rsquo;s accusation, raped the servant \u0026ldquo;in form similar to a man lying with a woman.\u0026rdquo; The Crown Princess also stalked and spied on Sossang and Danji to keep them apart, and jealously kept the fearful Sossang by her side.\nThis coerced sexual relationship between the Princess Consort and Sossang became known to the palace, and as it was adultery by the Princess Consort against her husband the Crown Prince, it was viewed as a violation of the royal family\u0026rsquo;s dignity and integrity and ultimately became the reason for the Princess\u0026rsquo;s expulsion from her position. The King considered the adultery with Sossang too shameful to publicly state as a reason for the expulsion, however, and named the Princess\u0026rsquo;s other misdeeds instead, such as jealousy of her husband\u0026rsquo;s concubines, peering at people outside through the servants\u0026rsquo; outhouse walls, and improper handling of royal property.\nThe king who made this decision, Sejong, professed a particular hatred for such illegitimate assignations between female servants, enslaved women and others, and discussed how he would have them corporeally punished by 70 blows to the buttocks and 100 more on repeat offenses. Given that these punishments used large wooden paddles, such beatings could result in not only injury but disability and even death. Believing that Heaven had guided his heart to hate the practice of female homosexuality, he boasted of reducing this custom with such strict measures. However, this was certainly not the last instance of recorded female homosexuality in the Joseon palace, as later discussed.\nFor context, it does not appear that female homosexuality was a particularly greater crime than illicit male-female sex. In the Great Laws of Ming (大明律), the criminal code of the Chinese Ming dynasty that became the basis of Joseon criminal law, the basic punishment for illegitimate sex between a man and woman who were not married to each other was 80 blows for both the man and woman, or 90 blows for a married woman. Of course, it is doubtful that the law was enforced for unmarried men and women who had consenting sex, for both lack of social stigma for such activities and limitations in state resources. However, Sejong\u0026rsquo;s own prohibition of relationships between palace servants was not a blanket ban on female homosexuality throughout the land of Joseon either, but rather took place in the specific context of the palace which was at the center and source of the kingdom\u0026rsquo;s Confucian rule, and where even unmarried servants were held to a standard of conduct befitting the dignity of the royal household.\nSources: Description of the Sossang incident, female palace servants and male attendants punished and enslaved for adultery and theft\nYi Seon (15th century): A nobleman\u0026rsquo;s male \u0026ldquo;concubine\u0026rdquo; and cuckoldry Also during the time of Sejong, a nobleman named Yi Seon was given high office and put in charge of Joseon\u0026rsquo;s military. The record of his promotion states three main points against Yi Seon\u0026rsquo;s character that made him unfit for office, in this order:\nHe is small-minded, stubborn, strange-tempered, arrogant, and is neither capable himself nor trusting of colleagues and subordinates, and thus almost always ruins the work wherever he goes.\nHe has a handsome male slave who he keeps in a room as he would a wife or concubine, who is indeed known in the neighborhood as Lord Yi\u0026rsquo;s concubine. This slave even goes willfully into the marital bedroom and sleeps with Yi Seon\u0026rsquo;s wife, with the noise audible from the outside, something Yi Seon neither prohibits nor minds.\nHe has his servants go around digging under the walls of his neighbors, causing the neighbors to move away when the walls cave, and he promptly incorporates these lands as fields attached to his own compound. He also incorporated a formerly communal well by putting a human corpse next to it and then walling it around when people stopped coming.\nThe perceived sexual inappropriateness of allowing his male lover to commit adultery with his wife, it seemed, was considered to be equivalent with other character flaws of incompetence and avarice in one of the highest officials in the land. This was not considered a criminal offense, however, though the handling of property may well have constituted a crime if laws were properly enforced, or even a disqualification given that Yi Seon continued to serve in high office.\nSource: Allegations of Yi Seon\u0026rsquo;s poor character\nLady Bak (15th century): Manufactured allegations of affairs with maidservants A lady from the house Bak, the wife of Prince Je-an of the royal family, was alleged to have been in affairs with three maidservants. Lady Bak herself maintained her innocence, saying that it was the maidservants who tried to seduce her, forcibly kissed her, and touched her breasts without her consent. Under interrogation a maidservant confessed that the prince\u0026rsquo;s nurse was behind it, trying to frame Lady Bak so the prince could remarry his former wife. In the end, despite the lady\u0026rsquo;s proven innocence, Prince Je-an convinced his kinsman King Seongjong to let him divorce Lady Bak and remarry his divorced wife Lady Kim. Though this is not a case of consensual homosexual activity between women, it shows that female homosexuality was a known practice and was potentially marriage-ending and incriminating much like adultery with a man.\nSources: Kang Moon-jong (2015), Allegations against Lady Bak\nPalace attendants (15th-18th centuries): Complaints and alleged punishments of female homosexuality Photograph from 1906 at the royal palace. Image source\nPalace attendants (內人, na-in) and senior ladies (尙宮, sanggung) were a different class of women from the enslaved women who served at the palace, though in a broad sense they might all be called palace attendants (宮女 gungnyeo, 宮人 gung-in). In the narrow sense, palace attendants were not menial laborers of the palace but professional assistants, craftswomen, and cooks who had their own maidservants. The attendnts were taught to read and write Hangul, and attended the royals close by or were in charge of the royals\u0026rsquo; food, clothing, and decorations. The sanggung, meanwhile, were the senior management who gave orders to the na-in. The term \u0026ldquo;attendants,\u0026rdquo; for the purpose of this section, refers to this narrow sense of more elite palace workers, and will include the sanggung because they were promoted from the ranks of na-in.\nAttendants were born of a range of different classes, from enslaved to nobility. Their special functions in the palace set them apart with certain significant benefits such as higher wages than most women of the time could command, social status, and a degree of leisure. These privileges also entailed many restrictions, a major one being that they could not leave the palace except on special occasions, when expelled, or when sick or close to death. Another was that they were forbidden to marry as they were technically sexually committed and available to the king, though this remained theoretical for almost all of these women and in practice it meant enforced celibacy. Adultery with men was punishable by death, for instance.\nThere are seeming allegations of adultery with women as well, that is between each other or with outside women, though the references are not entirely clear and an oft-cited example does not appear to be about homosexuality at all. That is, though it was alleged by some modern commentators that the reference in late 15th-century records to attendants sharing friendship (gyobung) with each other meant female homosexuality, punishable by being branded with the words \u0026ldquo;illegal friendship (違法交朋), an examination of the primary record does not indicate anything sexual about these illegal friendships and the punishment for them but rather factionism/partisanship and breach of palace security.\nGyobung has been used elsewhere in the records in a political sense referring to \u0026ldquo;factions of friends (朋堂)\u0026rdquo; meaning partisanship that was widely decried as a source of political disorder and corruption. The complaint about palace attendants\u0026rsquo; gyobung, furthermore, was about attendants forming factions and leaking palace secrets, and from my reading there was no sexual content to these accusations.2 Nevertheless, given the listing of gyobung as a term for female homosexuality and leaving open the possibility that I may have missed some nuances and references as a non-expert researcher, I am mentioning these passages and linking to the online database so others may judge for themselves.\nA somewhat likelier reference to female homosexuality by palace attendants is a complaint from the 18th century that attendants were consorting with crafty Buddhist nuns and lowborn widows and calling it daeshik. Daeshik, as discussed above in the terminology section, means sharing meals together, in this context visits by friends from outside the palace, and was also a widespread term in premodern Korea for homosexuality.\nIn full context this complaint may also refer to the need for order and secrecy in the palace, as the immediately preceding passage discusses corruption and the leakage of palace secrets. The use of the term daeshik is nevertheless suggestive, and may have been a veiled reference to the entwined problems of corruption, security breaches, and sexual inappropriateness in the palace. This may have been as close to a reference as propriety allowed in open court. This is in contrast to the passages involving Princess Consort Bong\u0026rsquo;s rape of the maidservant Sossang, which recorded consultations made in secret between Sejong and his closest advisors because the matter was so sensitive. Certainly, given how widespread the use of \u0026ldquo;daeshik\u0026rdquo; was, it is unlikely that a classically educated audience of courtiers were ignorant of the innuendo.\nIt is further worth noting that the crafty nuns and lowborn widows referenced in the complaint are female counterparts to the \u0026ldquo;common ruffians and unseemly monks\u0026rdquo; referenced by Yi Gyu-gyeong while discussing male homosexuality, see next section. In this way, the daeshik custom between palace attendants presents a window into female homosexuality in other sections of society as well, where despite the kingdom\u0026rsquo;s repressive mores the people were subject to far less direct control in sexual matters.\nAs also noted in the section on Sossang and Danji, prohibitions and penalties were not unique to female homosexuality in a palace setting, with prohibitions against adultery with men being at least as heavy. In fact by the time of King Yeongjo, when the above complaint was made, the laws had become considerably stricter for palace attendants who consorted with outside men, a crime made punishable by beheading of both the man and woman in Yeongjo\u0026rsquo;s time as opposed to corporeal punishment. These heavy penalties were unique to palace attendants given their special status and the duty of sexual fidelity/celibacy purportedly owed to the king. There is no evidence of a ban on homosexuality, male or female, for the general populace.\nVia Kang (2015), a number of scholars in the 18th and 19th centuries delved into the history of and terms for homosexuality, such as the origin and meaning of terms such as daeshik and namchong. Of these, Yi Hakgyu explained the meaning of daeshik as a part of palace affairs and mentioned that it was quite popular at the time, providing farther record of daeshik as a continuing practice in the Joseon dynasty.\nSources: Encyclopedia of Korean Culture entry on palace attendants, complaint of attendants\u0026rsquo; partisanship and disclosure of palace secrets, branding punishment for \u0026ldquo;illegal friendship\u0026rdquo;, complaint of palace attendants\u0026rsquo; inappropriate behavior with outside women, reference to adultery between palace attendants and men being punishable by death\nRuffians and monks (18th-19th centuries): Practitioners of male homosexuality Yi Gyugyeong was an 18th to 19th century scholar whose greatest single work is the Oju Yeonmun Jangjeon San-go (五洲衍文長箋散稿), an encyclopedic compilation of over 1,400 entries comprising knowledge from around the world on a plethora of subjects from history and antiquity to science and agriculture. Homosexuality was one of the many subjects Yi Gyugyeong wrote about, and in exploring the history of namchong with examples from China and Japan, he ends the article on a note critical of homosexuality. \u0026ldquo;Who says this is a beautiful custom to be shared across the world? In our eastern land [Joseon], it is merely taught and learned between common ruffians and unseemly monks at temples.\u0026rdquo;\nThis offhand disapproving comment provides a window into the classes of men who were thought to engage in male homosexuality. Together with the above-discussed complaints of \u0026ldquo;crafty nuns and lowborn widows\u0026rdquo; as purveyors of daeshik, it may be indicative of the intertwining of class and position with sexual inappropriateness such as homosexuality: The unpropertied, unmarrigeable, and monastic outside the strict Confucian order built onthe idea of a propertied male-headed household.\nGiven the long and widespread practice of homosexuality in Korea, however, Yi Gyugyeong\u0026rsquo;s claim of its confinement to certain defined and despised classes seems more based on ideal than fact. Kings during the Goryeo dynasty were in open homosexual relationships, and a leading literary talent of the day wrote in praise of homosexual love. Even in the Joseon period there were high-ranking officials in open homosexual relationships in the early years of the dynasty, and there are persistent records of working-class women engaging in female homosexuality in the royal palace of Joseon.\nConclusions Records from premodern Korea going back over 1,000 years attest to the existence of people who did not conform to strict ideas of cisnormativity and heteronormativity. While the existence of homosexual, bisexual, and gender non-conforming people is a constant, there have been different understandings of attitudes toward their proclivities, from a gender inversion by Heaven to refined courtly love to social disorder and adultery against the King. Queer people have always been here and are no Western invention, and understandings of our existence will always be contextual and dynamic. One constant seems to be that the open existence of queer people outside of narrow constraints is construed as a threat to prevailing orders of patriarchy and property, or outside or parallel to such dominant order. This may be the ultimate subsersive promise of queerness. If being queer can threaten and dismantle kingdoms, what are the other possibilities?\nIn contrast yeosaek 女色 (\u0026ldquo;sex with women\u0026rdquo;) was used not for homosexuality between women but rather male desire of women, showing the bias toward men as the agents of sexual desire.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTo clarify, though I relied heavily on Professor Kang Moon-jong\u0026rsquo;s paper, this error was not from his work but from other popular sources of information on the subject.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/queer-premodern-korea/","summary":"Who could their emulation of / the courtly love infringe?","title":"Records of homosexuality in premodern Korea"},{"content":" The Lantern and the Night Moths (2024 Invisible Publishing) is a collection of modern and contemporary Chinese poetry translated by Yilin Wang and accompanied by Wang\u0026rsquo;s original essays. The diverse works and voices represented are made accessible by the lyrical, heartfelt translations no matter what the reader\u0026rsquo;s relationship with the original language: Shaky and uncertain in my case, but with no barriers to non-speakers and likely enjoyable even to fluent Chinese speakers for the lesser-traveled route through modernist Chinese poetry and the author\u0026rsquo;s deft guide through poetics, literary history, and the art of translation.\nIt was quite the experience to be immersed in such different ages and styles in one volume, from feminist revolutionary Qiu Jin\u0026rsquo;s fierce yearnings expressed in classical form, to early modernist Fei Ming\u0026rsquo;s bridging between the old and new in experimental, enigmatic verse. Poet-translator Dai Wangshu\u0026rsquo;s wistful reflections, together with contemporary poets Zhang Qiaohui and Xiao Xi\u0026rsquo;s everyday imagery and vivid poetic language, completed the journey through modernity to the present.\nThe effect is one of lively dialogue between these remarkable poets through their differences and convergences in style and imagery. \u0026ldquo;I shall declare, I have swept the dust of the world away,\u0026rdquo; proclaims the rebellious warrior Qiu Jin, while Fei Ming philosophically muses, \u0026ldquo;the universe is a particle of indestructible dust floating in the air.\u0026rdquo; Zhang Qiaohui patiently builds narrative in weighty blocks of language (\u0026ldquo;a pseudo-classical reconstruction made of bricks and reinforced concrete/It comforts me with its mundanity\u0026rdquo;) while Xiao Xi throws searing moments packaged in the rhythm of hyper-condensed language that beats with the consciousness of the now (\u0026ldquo;some people . . . auction their kidneys off to pay for iPhones\u0026rdquo;). Dai Wangshu, a seasoned flyer between worlds of thought and language, casually melds Asian and European philosophy together (\u0026ldquo;I think, therefore I am a butterfly\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;) and sinks deep into existential meditations that waver like a flame between meanings, skillfully captured by the translator.\nA must-read for anyone with a stake in the art of poetry and its translation, The Lantern and the Night Moths is a unique and necessary collection that raises urgent questions about the future of translation and translators in an age of upheaval, where old forms of devaluation and exploitation\u0026mdash;as brought home by the British Museum\u0026rsquo;s uncredited and unpaid use of Wang\u0026rsquo;s Qiu Jin translations for its 2023 exhibit\u0026mdash;coexist with the new in the use of technological sleight-of-hand to erase and appropriate translators\u0026rsquo; labor. The Lantern and the Night Moths is both a literary treat and a clarion call that contains multitudes in a slim volume, a celebration, mourning, and hopeful anticipation of what has been and might yet be.\nNote: I have received an advance copy of The Lantern and the Night Moths to write a review for Exchanges available here, but have also pre-ordered it on my own since.

Still, lately I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing a little better and am feeling less stressed by giving myself permission to do things in small increments without feeling the need to turn the house upside down or do everything at once.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been aware for a while that I should do things in small increments, but it really came into focus for me with housekeeping advice videos I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to. They all emphasized that cleaning is a matter of habit, not the occasional Herculean effort and helped me realize I\u0026rsquo;d been psyching myself out of consistent cleaning by thinking I needed to take out a full day to get EVERYTHING done in one go.\nUnfortunately that was how I was brought up, with my mom telling me I should do the whole house when I cleaned because otherwise the dirt would spread from the uncleaned rooms to the clean one. So I ended up not cleaning on days I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the whole house, which was most days\u0026hellip; all days\u0026hellip; yeah.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s some truth in what she said and I know she meant to help and not sabotage me, but it turned out to be unhelpful once I started keeping a home. I\u0026rsquo;m not a stay-at-home mom the way she was, I work for income in a home that\u0026rsquo;s still in the process of decluttering. Daily full house-cleaning is just not in the cards at this point. The dirt-spreading effect is also greatly reduced if rooms are cleaned on rotation because there\u0026rsquo;s less dirt overall to spread around. It\u0026rsquo;s a heck of a lot better than not getting started in the first place, don\u0026rsquo;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good enough, etc.\nOnce I accepted my starting point and circumstances instead of holding myself to standards for a completely different situation, I could start cleaning and tidying in bits and pieces rather than try to do everything all at once or organize a Grand Day of Reckoning after which everything would be perfect. Not like I\u0026rsquo;m opposed to big cleaning days, they can be satisfying and helpful, but a) they are intimidating to arrange and get started on, and b) I know myself well enough to realize that without a consistent habit things are going to fall apart around my ears again. Ask me how I know. Cries in years of exhausted ADHD working parent\nIn recent days I\u0026rsquo;ve been setting myself limited tasks every day, ideally with just one focus, such as \u0026ldquo;get the gross grease and food gunk off the kitchen floor with Magic Blocks and elbow oil. Yeah, just the floor, do not do the counters, do not clean the oven,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;sweep the home office floor\u0026mdash;yeah I know it\u0026rsquo;s a huge cluttered mess, we can get to that, just clean the reachable parts, please.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd you know what? Things are better. Not perfect, I can still identify problems everywhere I look, but floors are cleaner and don\u0026rsquo;t feel disgusting to walk on. It gives me more energy and confidence to start working on bigger-ticket items, like space management in the home office, the big\u0026hellip; basically\u0026hellip; pile of garbage on the verandah, and the related entanglements of family-given items we don\u0026rsquo;t have a use for, the organizational issues of tossing vs. rehoming, guilt about potentially creating so much waste and so on.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s okay. We\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out as we go. Not in one fell swoop, not on a Day of Salvation that will be the end of our problems, but bit by bit as time goes on and while we\u0026rsquo;re kind to ourselves moving the business of Life along.\nThis morning my husband and I cleaned the living room sitting mat and the floor underneath which was ick but doable, and we felt a lot better afterward. That\u0026rsquo;s our cleaning for today. Tomorrow I\u0026rsquo;ll probably wipe down and clean the big bedroom floor. That\u0026rsquo;ll be it for tomorrow. Eventually we\u0026rsquo;ll figure out things that take more organization and have more moving pieces, and we\u0026rsquo;ll get there. We will gradually, inexorably, habitually unfuck our habitat and feel more in control and relaxed about the house.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll never live in a magazine-ready home but it\u0026rsquo;ll be cozy and ours, which is what counts. I know it works, because it\u0026rsquo;s already working and we\u0026rsquo;ll keep at it. It\u0026rsquo;ll be okay.

This post is an edited version of the Goodreads review I posted. If you care about spoilers for non-fiction books, this review contains a discussion of the ending.\nAlso a warning for discussion of interpersonal antisemitism, which I did not include in the original Goodreads review.\nSad Sacked is a humorous and vividly-written exploration of a U.S. middle-class suburban family\u0026rsquo;s brush with financial insecurity when the author\u0026rsquo;s husband Rich loses his job and the family lives for a year on his severance package. The whole time the author scrambles to keep everything together, taking on crappy writing jobs to pay the bills while trying to motivate Rich to get a new job.\nI sympathized deeply with the author\u0026rsquo;s growing anxiety and frustration as the shadow of her husband\u0026rsquo;s unemployment grew longer and financial apocalypse loomed, all the while squeezed by the pressure to keep up with the Jones in her affluent New Jersey neighborhood. It\u0026rsquo;s both an intimate portrayal of one family\u0026rsquo;s struggle and a dark look into the evaporation of employment and financial security even for the more affluent classes of U.S. society and elsewhere.\nThat said, I found the narrative ultimately limited by a seeming inability to think outside the status quo. (This is solely based on what was in the book, of course, since no doubt a lot more took place in real life than could be written about.) I found myself annoyed by the author and her husband\u0026rsquo;s seeming unwillingness to communicate about what seemed like conflicting goals and wants. The possibility of moving to a less expensive neighborhood is brought up but never seriously discussed or planned for in the narrative of the book, even though Rich drags his feet on looking for a new job for half a year. It\u0026rsquo;s mentioned from the start that he\u0026rsquo;s unhappy and disenchanted with his job, yet this appears to be dismissed as unimportant in the overriding quest to keep the family in their current lifestyle and neighborhood.\nThis unwillingness to communicate builds up resentments and ugly fights between the couple as pressures and anxieties mount, culminating in an antisemitic moment over the holidays when the author tells her husband that Christmas\u0026mdash;a holiday he had been celebrating with her and their three children all their marriage and possibly before\u0026mdash;isn\u0026rsquo;t his holiday.\nIt felt weird because there\u0026rsquo;s no self-reflection in the book about making such a hurtful and exclusionary comment, or a serious apology from what I could tell. It\u0026rsquo;s even more surreal because the very next scene is of their neighbor making a comment stereotyping Jewish people and the author, while recognizing the bigotry, doesn\u0026rsquo;t push back against it. So what I get out of what Liz Alterman has chosen to present in her own memoir, leaving aside the complexities of real life that I\u0026rsquo;m not privy to, is that she gets bigoted toward her own husband when she\u0026rsquo;s angry enough, doesn\u0026rsquo;t apologize for it, and also doesn\u0026rsquo;t defend him when others are bigoted against him. That was certainly a choice.\nMoving on to the ending: I usually wouldn\u0026rsquo;t discuss endings in a review of a book that has a narrative, even non-fiction, but it\u0026rsquo;s a big chunk of what spoiled (heh) the book for me so I figured I\u0026rsquo;d go into it. Spoiler alert, the husband does get a new and higher-paying job at the last minute as his severance runs out. The family get to keep the house and go on as before. Yay, all\u0026rsquo;s well that ends well, right?\nUnfortunately it rang hollow for me, because the only thing the couple seems to have learned from this time in their life is that they need to be grateful, not take anything for granted, and work hard. Evidently it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter that the husband was miserable working in this field. No, he should be grateful to have a job at all and he\u0026rsquo;s learned his lesson! Don\u0026rsquo;t even think about the possibility of a new career/lifestyle or stepping off the light-speed social prestige treadmill, just keep your head down, say yes sir and yes ma\u0026rsquo;am, and keep working!\nThe final chapter/epilogue where the author states these lessons felt creepily docile and saccharine, so unlike the verve and humor that had attracted me to the book in the first place. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s appropriate for an ending that may read on the surface as happy but is actually one of accepting the status quo and learning to comply with it. This lack of imagination, this beaten-down acquiescence to social pressure, may be the most sadsack thing about Sad Sacked.\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/sad-sacked-review/","summary":"This memoir of a middle-class family\u0026rsquo;s brush with unemployment was funny and vivid in parts, but ultimately unsatisfying.","title":"[Review] Sad Sacked by Liz Alterman"},{"content":"This post was adapted from a Mastodon post I wrote on January 21, 2023.\nRead the story first! The Schwarzschild Defence (2023) by M. V. Melcer is a very fun short science fiction story and highly recommended reading. UPDATE (June 23, 2024): Given the story is now paywalled, I replaced the link with an archived version. I particularly love its punchy style that delivers so much in so few words. Its choices are effective for the story told, from the format giving only one side of the interview to the downright chilling twists, delivered so nonchalantly. It feels fresh while maintaining a classic sci-fi feel, down to the commentary on gender roles and violence against women (consider that a content warning).\nStill, I can\u0026rsquo;t be the only one who thinks the argument as presented doesn\u0026rsquo;t work legally or even physics-wise, right? If you like overthinking things, and more importantly if you\u0026rsquo;ve read the story, maybe you\u0026rsquo;d like to join me in overthinking a delightful story!\nSeriously. Read it. It\u0026rsquo;s less than a thousand words and brilliantly written. I\u0026rsquo;ll wait.\nChecking the laws So, can you see which parts don\u0026rsquo;t hold up? Legally speaking, even if we take the narrator of the story, let\u0026rsquo;s call her \u0026ldquo;Mileva,\u0026rdquo; at her word that Xavier will not die (a claim I highly doubt, see below), she has by her admission committed some pretty serious crimes.\nOne is the crime of false imprisonment, meaning detaining someone against their will without legal justification. Mileva sabotaged Xavier into an inescapable prison and there\u0026rsquo;s no way this doesn\u0026rsquo;t count as false imprisonment, especially when she was reckless enough to admit at least twice to the police that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t what Xavier intended or wanted with the flight.\nIn the jurisdiction I live in, false imprisonment carries a penalty of up to 10 years\u0026rsquo; incarceration if committed against a spouse or other close family member. Committing cruel acts against a close family member while keeping them falsely imprisoned carries a penalty of at least 2 years\u0026rsquo; imprisonment. The penalty is increased by up to 50% if the false imprisonment is done with the possession of a dangerous object, and both the black hole and the tampered-with spaceship arguably qualify.\nOverall, Mileva is looking at some pretty heavy charges and had better get her lawyers scrambling. Given the severity of the effects, the incontrovertible evidence, and her intent, freely admitted to a police detective\u0026mdash;without a lawyer to advise her, what was she thinking?!\u0026mdash;to trap Xavier in the black hole, it is very likely she will have the book thrown at her.\nMileva has also, by her admission, tampered with sensitive equipment, damaging Xavier\u0026rsquo;s property knowing he is undertaking a dangerous and sensitive flight. Through this she caused Xavier to make unwanted contact with the event horizon of the black hole, which is battery.\nEven if Xavier suffers no other physical harm (which I doubt, more on that soon), slowing down his physical process well beyond human levels is unwanted interference with his body, a form of inflicted physical injury that exacerbates the crimes of false imprisonment and battery. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there have been more crimes committed, but these are some of the big ones.\nChecking the laws of physics The charges outlined above rest on Mileva\u0026rsquo;s insistence that Xavier is physically unharmed and will live a long, long time in the black hole. But will he? I\u0026rsquo;m not formally trained in physics so I\u0026rsquo;m on less certain ground here, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem that way to me, and discussions like this one seem to confirm my suspicion.\nIf time slows down as you go down a black hole and the gravitational pull becomes inescapable, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t the parts of the spaceship and of Xavier be pulled down at different rates, meaning he and the spaceship will be literally atomized? If anything he\u0026rsquo;s going to have the longest, most protracted death ever. Not that I care, the guy\u0026rsquo;s an ass and deserves it, but the whole twist of the story depends on Mileva\u0026rsquo;s actions not being murder.\nI mean maybe Mileva is right, and the story was worded very cleverly here, that this Xavier-molasses and his eventual atom-level dissolution will happen so slowly in a Schwarzschild black hole, at a time scale well beyond everyone\u0026rsquo;s lifespans, that it can\u0026rsquo;t be murder in the conventional sense. Murder revolves around the idea of cutting someone\u0026rsquo;s life short, so what do you do when someone stretches it out, longer and longer beyond the shape lives were ever meant to take, before a horrible end?\nThis is why I believe the better legal tacks to take are false imprisonment, battery, and attendant serious injury with property damage and sabotage sprinkled in for spice. But under no circumstance can Mileva get away scot-free as she claims.\nNotes \u0026amp; conclusions I\u0026rsquo;d like to note this isn\u0026rsquo;t me endorsing the incarceral state, far less the misogyny and threats Mileva was subjected to by her account. All I\u0026rsquo;m doing is analyzing the internal logic of the story, which is remarkable for raising these questions at all. If Isaac Asimov in his classic The Billiard Ball (1967) can stretch, or shall we say fail to stretch, the science in almost exactly the same way,1 I don\u0026rsquo;t see why M. V. Melcer can\u0026rsquo;t be afforded the same leniency. Science fiction is fiction in the end, and between perfect fidelity to the facts and a good story there\u0026rsquo;s no harm in choosing the latter.\nI also think that, if we read the story \u0026ldquo;straight\u0026rdquo; along with the fact-checking, a very different reading can emerge than the original impression of a domestic violence survivor putting her abuser away from good and walking away cackling with his fortune: Instead the story can become one of a traumatized survivor who saved herself with an unthinkable act of desperation that has changed her forever, and ended up self-sabotaging herself in her panic and inability to accept the reality of what she\u0026rsquo;s done. That\u0026rsquo;s another thing about fiction, that it\u0026rsquo;s roomy enough for different interpretations, and arguably it\u0026rsquo;s a great story that can admit so many readings in such an economy of words.\nIn the author\u0026rsquo;s notes for the edition of The Billiard Ball in one of his short story collections, Asimov freely admitted to fudging the science for that story to make the plot work.

With no way to prevent this terrible infectious disease which had a mortality rate of up to 80% and often left survivors scarred and disabled, we called smallpox by names like “Great Lady” or “Great Guest.”\nYou could not try to exorcise or even use medicine against the Lady-God; you offered her food and prayed to her in the hope she would spare your loved one, who all too often was a child. Make her angry by disrespecting her, and she could kill the patient or leave them alive but badly scarred, even blinded.\nThough the god of smallpox has been personified as different genders and forms from all walks of life, as befitting a disease that could be spread and suffered by anyone, the most familiar shamanic representation is that of a beautiful young woman and that is the version I will go with.\nA painting of Hogumama, the smallpox goddess. Source\nNow, one figure from the Korean kingdom of Silla in the late ninth century earned the respect and repentance of this terrible and formidable god. This man, Cheoyong(處容), has a strange story of his own:\nHeon-gang, the king of Silla at the time, was returning from a seaside excursion when all of a sudden cloud and fog rolled in, causing the entire party to lose their way. The royal sun-administrator, as the weather official who was also in charge of weather-related omens and divination, advised the king that this was the work of the Dragon King of the East Sea, who should be appeased by some good deed.\nThough the king was skeptical, no one could see anything because of the strange weather and he had to do something. He ordered a temple be built in that place for the dragon; the instant he said the words, the fog and clouds disappeared.\nPleased at this respectful treatment from the king, the Dragon of the East Sea appeared before the royal retinue with his seven sons to dance and play music, praising the king’s virtue. The dragon then left one of his sons, Cheoyong, with the king to aid him at the capital. The king, happy to have the Dragon’s son by his side, arranged his match to a beautiful woman and gave him a high office to have him settle in the capital.\nCheoyong’s wife was very beautiful, and was admired by all. The god of plague, enamored of her, transformed to come to Cheoyong’s house and secretly lie in his wife’s bed. Cheoyong came home late at night to look upon his bed, only to see two people in it. One was his wife, but he did not recognize the other. At the sight he withdrew, dancing and singing:\n東京明期月良\n夜入伊遊行如可\n入良沙寢矣見昆\n脚烏伊四是良羅\n二兮隐吾下於叱古\n二兮隐誰支下焉古\n本矣吾下是如馬於隐\n奪叱良乙何如爲理古\nThrough the city in the light of the moon\nI did frolic in the deep of night\nI look upon the couch on coming home\nAnd four legs greet my astonished sight.\nTwo were mine\nWhose are the other two?\nWhat once was mine\nWas taken, what can I do?\nThe god of plague showed her true form and knelt before Cheoyong, contrite. Said she, “I envied your wife and have now violated her. Yet you showed no anger at the sight, and this beautiful conduct has moved me deeply. I swear to you, if I but see your form in paint I will not enter that door.”\nThis was how people started putting up portraits of Cheoyong to deter plague and for good luck. The temple the king built for the dragon was called Mang-hae-sa (望海寺), the Temple of the Ocean View. Cheoyong\u0026rsquo;s song and dance named for him have been passed on to posterity and the dance is performed to this day, designated as a UNESCO intangible heritage.\nThe Middle Eastern hypothesis of Cheoyong\u0026rsquo;s origin One intriguing hypothesis about Cheoyong’s identity is that he was an Arab or Persian merchant, possibly a doctor. Though there are no explicit records, traders from the Middle East may have been in Silla at this time. At the very least Silla was known in the Middle East, with scholars such as Ibn Khurdaziba in the ninth century writing about Silla as a land beyond China where Muslims happily settled because it was a such a good and plentiful land\u0026mdash;as Cheoyong did in the story. In the Persian epic poem Kush-Nama the hero Abtin marries Fararang, a princess of Basila which is alleged to be a mythical version of Silla.\nAlso, the later Korean dynasty of Goryeo clearly did engage in trade with the Islam world. Not only are there records of large trading parties from the land of Daesik (對食國), meaning Arabia, the name “Korea” itself became known to the West through Middle Eastern merchants. It is an intriguing possibility that exchange between the Korean Peninsula and the Middle East started even before it was formally recorded in the Goryeo era, with the tale of Cheoyong passed down as a mythologized hint much like Ibn Khurdaziba\u0026rsquo;s writings on Silla or the adventures of the Kush-Nama.\nThe accounts of Cheoyong’s appearance before the king are suggestive as well. The fact that he and his family rose out of the sea could be a mythologized rendition of their seafaring, while their strange appearance and clothing astonished the Korean onlookers and caused them to call the strangers “spirits of the sea.” More specifically, Cheoyong was said to have deep-set eyes and a prominent nose, features that have been preserved in an exaggerated form in his portraiture and the mask performers wear for his dance.\nA performance of Cheoyong\u0026rsquo;s dance in his mask. Source\nThe Islamic world also had some of the most advanced medical knowledge in the world at this time, building on the preserved knowledge from the classical world and adding to it with innovation and observation. The year 879 when Cheoyong was said to have come from the sea was early in the career of Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (854-925), a Persian doctor and polymath who wrote a pioneering book on smallpox and measles.\nIf Cheoyong were a Middle Eastern man with medical knowledge he may well have had access to the kind of research and methods Al-Razi used, if not the specific book, which may have enabled him to treat people afflicted with smallpox. These events may then have been mythologized as Koreans at the time understood it, a ceremonial appeasement of the smallpox god, making him an enduring legend and himself a beloved god in our pantheon.\nIn conclusion: Solidarity in times of plague Cheoyong’s exact identity and background, including whether he was a real person, will always remain mysterious and up for debate. Nevertheless, the possibility that he was an Arab or Persian is particularly poignant at a time when COVID-19 is bringing out virulent xenophobia and racism around the world. Cheoyong may well have been a foreigner risking his life in a strange land to help patients struck with a deadly and highly contagious disease.\nAnd now, 1,100 years later, Iran is hard hit by the disease and by the sanctions that are undercutting its response. It is requesting Korea’s aid to secure more testing kits for citizens, an effort made difficult by the sanctions imposed against it. This may very well be the time Korea can repay the debt it owes Cheoyong. Wouldn’t such beautiful conduct move even the fearsome god of plague?\nReferences The original tale: Ilyeon (1281, King Chungryeol Year 7).

Plot twist, I actually stuck to it! Just don\u0026rsquo;t ask about the state of my physical activity habit, please.\nHere are the year\u0026rsquo;s writing statistics from writing most days from January 2 to December 31, 2022, taken using functionalities and packages of Emacs Org Mode, and my takeaways from these numbers.\nThe words and the hours According to a word count and Org Mode\u0026rsquo;s clock table report, I wrote somewhere around 170,000 words this year in 11 days, 2 hours, and 9 minutes, or around 266 hours of writing.\nThese numbers come with some caveats: The word count function does give me an exact count, 174,369, but this is an overcount that includes elements that won\u0026rsquo;t be exported such as header (scene) labels, in-file notes, and time stamps. This works for me, since I only need a rough estimate of where I am and not a laser-precise word count. Besides, even considering the overcount I know this is Too Much! I\u0026rsquo;m going to hate my first-draft self once I have my editing hat on, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure.\nThe hours spent writing are similarly imprecise. I started using Org Mode\u0026rsquo;s clocking commands fairly early in the year (January 5) to start keeping track of writing time, and there\u0026rsquo;s some undercount from the first few days when the clock was not used. Discounting that fairly small gap, which can\u0026rsquo;t be by more than 2 hours, I was also inconsistent at times about running the clock. Sometimes I ran the clock but was not writing, and at other times it was the other way around, though this was rarer. For these reasons both the word count and reported time are more estimates than exact measures.\nWords per hour and day Keeping those limitations in mind, a very rough estimate of my writing speed this year was 639 words/hour, and I wrote an average of 465 words a day during the year, counting the skipped days. On the days I did write the average was 544 words a day.\nThe estimated hourly word rate largely matches up with what I\u0026rsquo;ve sensed on a regular day of writing, that I tend to produce about 100 words per 10 minutes or maybe a little more. The per-day rate is a bit of a surprise, given that my goal was to write 300 words a day and I often did stop at almost exactly 300 words, especially on days the words weren\u0026rsquo;t coming. I guess it makes sense though, since I did overachieve a lot of days, by a lot at times.\nThe ironic/interesting part is, I think it was my keeping the goal at 300 words that allowed me to write an average of 500 words a day. A lot of days I could only bear to start writing because I told myself I just had to do 300 words, and actually stopped at 300 when I was struggling and tired. There were many days I could not have started at all at the thought of having to write 500 words a day, and that would have meant a lot fewer words.\nHabit consistency and achievement In addition to writing and getting these stats in Org Mode, I had also been tracking my writing as a habit. At the end of 2022 I used a neat package called org-habit-stats to get a calendar view and some statistics on the writing habit.\nAccording to the statistics, I wrote 312 days out of the year, or 85% of days in 2022. Nearly a third of the missed days come from February when I was having a hard time keeping up with writing, as seen in this calendar view of writing statistics:\nAs you can see I generally wrote on most days of the month, usually missing two to four days in a month. Those would have been the days when I was overwhelmed by work or family obligations, or just needed a break.\nThe one outlier is February, when I was missing over half the days of the month. This was likely because I was wrapping up my last academic gig during that month before I turned to full-time translation in March, something that made a huge difference in my free time and energy levels.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t as though I became a different person with more energy or \u0026ldquo;willpower\u0026rdquo; between the end of February and the start of March. I had simply structured my life in a way that made room for writing and that made all the difference, which may be the true takeaway from this year of writing.\nNumbers, for what they\u0026rsquo;re worth Word count and hours spent writing are just numbers at the end of the day\u0026ndash;or year, as it were. They\u0026rsquo;re mostly meaningful to me as an indication for how far I\u0026rsquo;ve come, even as I realize how far I still have to go. The story has grown in length far beyond my original expectations and I\u0026rsquo;m just slogging on to get to the end of my originally envisioned story, so I can turn around to figure out stuff like editing (I expect to cut extravagantly) and book divisions.\nI\u0026rsquo;d frankly have been happier to have reached the end of my draft than to have written so many words, but I\u0026rsquo;m letting the process take control for now as I try to feel out the world and narrative by writing through them. Stats are one part of that journey but far from the whole experience, any more than kilometers and hours driven can tell you about the scenery seen outside the window or the smell of the car seats.\nWhat is most meaningful to me about my writing habit is that the dream of writing this story is no longer a dream but my waking reality, and that it will be done at some point barring some huge, unforeseen change. I know I am moving toward the endpoint, steadily if slowly. Once I get there, I will know the key was the momentum of consistent habit.\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/2022-writing-review/","summary":"What is most meaningful to me about my writing habit is that the dream of writing this story is no longer a dream, but my waking reality.","title":"Writing year in review: My 2022 writing habit on Emacs"},{"content":"A little background \u0026amp; why B2? It was kind of background knowledge for me that object storage was an option in Mastodon hosting, but I never felt much need for it on my tiny instance. Then it became an urgent issue when fedi activity exploded in November in the wake of the Twitter meltdown. My instance database started crashing from the 40 GB local drive overflowing with cached media, and constantly ran at above 30 GB even when I left only one day\u0026rsquo;s worth of cache at media cleanup (tootctl media remove --days 1).\nI already had a Backblaze/B2 account that I had been using for my personal offsite backups, and I calculated that I could similarly hook it up to my Hometown/Mastodon instance at a fraction of the cost of adding more storage volume to the Hetzner server. I also wanted to keep using B2 for this rather than create a new account with AWS or some other storage service, feeling no need to complicate things with yet another account and service to keep track of.\nThe problem I ran into was that this particular combination of Mastodon and B2 is woefully underdocumented, even with B2\u0026rsquo;s S3-compatibility. This led me into a lot of trial and error because the documentation I did find was outdated1 and/or did not mention issues unique to B2, like a huge authentication pitfall that I ended up pitching headfirst into.\nLet me discuss that pitfall first, in case you don\u0026rsquo;t need the rest of this guide: You need to use a B2 application key, NOT a master application key, for this purpose. If, like me, you have everything set up correctly and media uploads fail for an unexplained reason, this might be why. More details in Step 1 below.\nSo here it is, the walkthrough of the process and settings that I wished I had when I configured my setup, put together from other sources and my own trial and error.\nStep 1: Set up a B2 bucket and application key for your instance This part is going to be pretty obvious if you already use B2. Otherwise, the official tutorial for creating a bucket should be enough. Everything I have read says the privacy setting of the bucket should be public, though this comes at a risk because it means anyone can download from the bucket which could potentially eat into your traffic limit and cost you. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t done so already, you might have to verify your email to set the bucket to public.\nMake note of the bucket\u0026rsquo;s address, which will be the endpoint noted in your bucket information preceded by your bucket name. If you named your bucket my-instance-media your bucket address would be something like:\nmy-instance-media.s3.us-west-900.backblazeb2.com\nYou can verify this by uploading a file to the bucket and viewing the address of the file, which will be something like:\nmy-instance-media.s3.us-west-900.backblazeb2.com/my-test-file.txt\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have a B2 application key, their official tutorial should get you started. Also, as discussed above, make sure you use a non-master application key pair for this setup in Step 4 below. Master application keys are NOT S3-compatible (see \u0026ldquo;Warning\u0026rdquo;), and if you set up your .env.production with it your setup will not work!\nNote down the application key id-application key pair in a secure location such as your password manager, especially the application key which will only be shown once and never again in your browser interface or otherwise.\nStep 2: Set up a proxy on nginx As noted in the official Mastodon documentation, it is very much recommended that you set up a proxy local to the server to cache media requested from the bucket on your server. If every request were to go directly to your bucket your traffic meter could climb rapidly and cost you more money than it has to. I modeled my nginx configuration for this on a configuration for a different S3-compatible service, and followed the directions in the Mastodon documentation on configuring the proxy.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what my configuration, anonymized to /etc/nginx/sites-available/files.example.com, looks like:\nproxy_cache_path /tmp/nginx-cache-instance-media levels=1:2 keys_zone=s3_cache:10m max_size=10g inactive=48h use_temp_path=off; server { listen 443 ssl http2; listen [::]:443 ssl http2; # CUSTOMIZE THE VALUE BELOW TO YOUR OWN SUBDOMAIN server_name files.example.com; root /home/mastodon/live/public/system; access_log off; # CUSTOMIZE THE VALUE BELOW TO YOUR DESIRED ERROR LOG FILE NAME error_log /var/log/nginx/files-error.log; keepalive_timeout 60; location = / { index index.html; } location / { try_files $uri @s3; } # CUSTOMIZE THE VALUE BELOW TO YOUR BUCKET ADDRESS set $s3_backend \u0026#39;https://my-instance-media.s3.us-west-900.backblazeb2.com\u0026#39;; location @s3 { limit_except GET { deny all; } resolver 9.9.9.9; # CUSTOMIZE THE VALUE BELOW TO YOUR BUCKET ADDRESS proxy_set_header Host \u0026#39;my-instance-media.s3.us-west-900.backblazeb2.com\u0026#39;; proxy_set_header Connection \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; proxy_set_header Authorization \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; proxy_hide_header Set-Cookie; proxy_hide_header \u0026#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin\u0026#39;; proxy_hide_header \u0026#39;Access-Control-Allow-Methods\u0026#39;; proxy_hide_header \u0026#39;Access-Control-Allow-Headers\u0026#39;; proxy_hide_header x-amz-id-2; proxy_hide_header x-amz-request-id; proxy_hide_header x-amz-meta-server-side-encryption; proxy_hide_header x-amz-server-side-encryption; proxy_hide_header x-amz-bucket-region; proxy_hide_header x-amzn-requestid; proxy_ignore_headers Set-Cookie; proxy_pass $s3_backend$uri; proxy_intercept_errors off; proxy_cache s3_cache; proxy_cache_valid 200 304 48h; proxy_cache_use_stale error timeout updating http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504; proxy_cache_lock on; expires 1y; add_header Cache-Control public; add_header \u0026#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin\u0026#39; \u0026#39;*\u0026#39;; add_header X-Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status; } } The specific addresses and names should be customized to your desired settings, as marked in the configuration text.\nWhen the configuration file is written to your satisfaction, save it and symlink it from /etc/nginx/sites-enabled, and reload nginx by running (with sudo if you are not the root user here):\nln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/files.example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ systemctl reload nginx Then get a SSL certificate for the domain, as seen in the Mastodon documentation.\ncertbot --nginx -d files.example.com systemctl reload nginx This was the main place I diverged from the configuration posted on the thomas-leister.de website, by the way: I use port 443 for an encrypted connection per the Mastodon documentation rather than 80 for an unencrypted one like Thomas Leister did, mainly because the unencrypted connection broke all the images on my instance lol.\nStep 3: Upload existing Mastodon media to your bucket If your instance is already in use, you should upload previously downloaded media to the instance bucket. There are several different tools to achieve this, and if you already use an S3-compatible tool like aws or s3cmd it should do the job. Just be aware that you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use an S3-compatible non-master B2 application key to authenticate it, as discussed.\nI used the official b2 command line tool, since it\u0026rsquo;s a simple binary and fairly easy to use. I downloaded b2 for Linux through the link on this page, uploaded it to the /home/mastodon/live directory (though in hindsight its bin subdirectory would have been more fitting), changed the owner to the mastodon user with:\nsudo chown mastodon:mastodon b2-linux Switched to the mastodon user:\nsudo su - mastodon Changed the file name to b2 for simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake:\nmv b2-linux b2 Also gave it execution permission.\nchmod +x b2 I didn\u0026rsquo;t mess with $PATH or anything like that, since this wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be an everyday operation.\nYou can then create an authentication profile using the application key ID and application key pair generated in Step 1 above.\n./b2 authorize-account --profile my-instance $B2_Application_Key_ID $B2_Application_Key The variables $B2_Application_Key_ID and $B2_Application_Key should be replaced by the actual values, of course. Or you can actually define the variables I guess, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel the need since authentication was a one-time thing and, once successful, the switch --profile my-instance is enough to authenticate all operations.\nAfter setting up the profile with authorize-account you can use some short, harmless command like list-buckets to test whether authentication works:\n./b2 list-buckets --profile my-instance Or maybe try uploading a small file or something. The --help switch is helpful for figuring out the commands and syntax, or simply running b2 without any arguments will also bring up the help options.\nOnce authentication is confirmed to work, sync the public/system directory to the remote b2 bucket using the sync command. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to run some media cleanup commands to minimize the amount of files to upload to the bucket. Here are the ones I used, from /home/mastodon/bin:\n./tootctl media remove --days 1 ./tootctl media remove --prune-profiles ./tootctl media remove --remove-headers When you are ready to start moving the files, assuming the command is run from the /home/mastodon/live directory:\n./b2 sync --profile my-instance ./public/system/ b2://my-instance-media/ You can read more about b2\u0026rsquo;s sync command options, but I found the default options satisfactory.\nStep 4: Mastodon configuration My Mastodon configuration in live/.env.production to enable the object storage looks something like this:\nS3_ENABLED=true S3_PROTOCOL=https # EVERYTHING BELOW THIS POINT SHOULD BE CUSTOMIZED S3_BUCKET=my-instance-media AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$B2_Application_Key_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$B2_Application_Key S3_ALIAS_HOST=files.example.com S3_HOSTNAME=files.example.com S3_REGION=us-west-900 S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-west-900.backblazeb2.com In addition to the earlier point that the application key ID and application key pair should have been generated as a non-master application key, also note the https:// in front of the S3_ENDPOINT value. For me that was the final hurdle to getting the setup to work.\nSwitch to admin or some other user with sudo power. From the mastodon user, it just takes an exit command in my case. Restart the Mastodon processes:\nsudo systemctl restart mastodon-*.service Check if the instance works normally. If it\u0026rsquo;s down, the API call to Backblaze storage may be failing and the key id and application key values should be double-checked.\nStep 5: Check if object storage is working As discussed in the Thomas Leister writeup (\u0026ldquo;Checking if it works\u0026rdquo;), check the browser\u0026rsquo;s console to see if the correct server proxy is loading up for media, and whether media are properly displayed.\nAlso, try attaching a piece of media to a post. If the attachment fails with a 500 error, you need to check your settings.\nEven after I ironed out the authentication issues with the application key I found media uploads were, understandably, slower than before and they sometimes timed out. This was why I set the keepalive_timeout value to 60 rather than 30 in the nginx proxy settings and image uploads have not timed out since.\nThough Mastodon will be uploading new media to the remote bucket and requesting it remotely, for preexisting media files it will look to the local public/system directory first. This can make it harder to tell if the bucket setup is working or it\u0026rsquo;s just the local storage doing the work, so if you\u0026rsquo;re impatient you can get rid of that directory to force the instance to load everything from the bucket instead. From /home/mastodon/live/public you can run:\nmv system/ system_/ to change the name of the system directory without immediately deleting everything in it.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t simply leave public/system missing, though, if you want to keep the nginx proxy settings as they are. Guess who found out the hard way this will crash the instance\u0026hellip; :\u0026rsquo;) Instead, create a new empty system directory so the setting will have somewhere to look to and not throw an error.\nmkdir system If the media still loads properly after this, and new media is fetched and uploaded, it means the setup is working. Yay!\nCleanup, afterwork and thoughts You can let this setup run a few days to see whether it keeps working, doesn\u0026rsquo;t overrun your traffic meters etc., before you empty out your local public/system directory, or delete public/system_ if you did the directory switch I detailed above. I can tell you it was quite a weight off to reclaim half my disk space from all that media.\nI also ran some accounts refresh jobs because I had missing remote profile pics from emergency media deletions, back when my disk had overflowed and the database crashed. Yeah, things were that bad.\nMedia loads correctly again on my instance, though there is an initial loading time, and I can get a proper media cache going without my disk at constant risk of running out. Instance management has become enjoyable again without the constant risk of unplanned server downtime, and I am now able to consider putting other services on the server.\nIn the long term, media storage is something federated software and communities are going to have to figure out. Services like Jortage look interesting, and something like it may be the future of media storage in the fediverse. For now I have found a solution that works for my instance, and if this write-up helps others avoid some of my confusion and mistakes I will be happy\u0026ndash;although, let\u0026rsquo;s be real, these tech posts have mainly been helpful to myself for the purpose of record-keeping and documentation.\n(Updated on 12/18/2023: Fixed a line break in the first line of the nginx configuration, added an advisory to clean up media before syncing.)\nFor instance, there was a gist stating that Mastodon could not directly interface with B2 for object storage because B2 was not S3-compatible, and MinIO would be needed as a relay. This was seemingly confirmed by documentation from Backblaze itself stating its S3 incompatibility. Turns out this was back in 2019-2020 and, as of late 2022, B2 is S3 compatible and MinIO no longer provides the relay function. Guess who only realized this after installing MinIO.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/mastodon-b2/","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s how I set up a Backblaze B2 bucket with a local proxy for Mastodon object storage.","title":"Object storage on Mastodon with a Backblaze B2 bucket"},{"content":"Who?

Still, boy was that experience a crash course, emphasis on \u0026ldquo;crash,\u0026rdquo; in what does and does not work for me.\nIn which we start out with great expectations I\u0026rsquo;d been meaning for some time to work on the story idea I\u0026rsquo;d been sporadically working on and researching for since around 2008. I found the idea of National Novel-Writing Month attractive as a way of getting a first draft\u0026ndash;no matter how shitty\u0026ndash;in hand quickly. Between grad school and a job, it was hard to get the time and energy to write and I thought forcing myself to write a Ridiculous Amount every day might be a way to do it. You can probably glimpse the seeds of failure already in my line of thinking.\nAs I often do when I start something new, I read a whole book on the subject: No Plot? No Problem! by the founder of NaNo himself. I thought I had the idea down and liked the thought of getting words out in a gush from the subconscious, silencing the inner critic by making myself meet a word count threshold no matter what.\nAlready familiar with the technique from freewriting which I had used in journaling, I was ready to apply it to my first draft. I also had an outline ready ahead of time, since I was used to writing by outline.\nIn which our hero does everything right, or so she thought Come July, I wrote every single day. I wrote on subways and buses on commute; I wrote at home, I wrote riding on the exercise bike. About 50,000 words into my original outline and with time left in the month, I decided the direction I was taking the story didn\u0026rsquo;t work and outlined again. The second outline was a bust, too, and so was the short-lived third outline.\nStill, I kept writing no matter how crappy the output, trusting in the process and trying to soar on the wings of my subconscious through a maelstrom of terrible writing. By the end of the month I had blown past the original 50,000-word goal and pushed out 100,000 words on three different drafts. Progress, right?\nWell\u0026hellip; no. Not in a straight line, anyway. None of the drafts I had written ultimately worked, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even bear to look back on them, not only because they were awful and no longer usable for my evolving conception of the story, but because they were associated with the memory of pushing myself to write beyond my own comfort.\nMy problems didn\u0026rsquo;t stop with the unusable drafts: I also burned out on writing and couldn\u0026rsquo;t work on the story for months. I\u0026rsquo;d work on it for a few days and then put it on hold for months, even over a year at a time, not helped by the continuing rush of school and work. It would be a while and some life changes before I found a workable direction and a settled routine that let me make steady progress with the story.\nIn which we reflect on lessons learned Maybe NaNoWriMo did help me in the sense that I needed to run down those dead ends to get to where I am in the story, and NaNo let me get the trial-and-error out of the way on fast forward. Even more valuable, though, was that I learned about my own process as a writer, both what works and doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for me.\nFirst, the freewriting-style \u0026ldquo;let your subconscious take over\u0026rdquo; school of writing does not work for me when writing fiction. I\u0026rsquo;d gotten some mileage out of it for journaling, as discussed, but it\u0026rsquo;s just not how I work on story drafts, even first drafts. I certainly don\u0026rsquo;t need or want a perfect, or even good, first draft, but I do need to put some thought into making things at least coherent if I want to make the draft a meaningful basis for future work.\nSecond, for me, forcing a large word count is a recipe for burnout. It\u0026rsquo;s too painful, and ultimately unsustainable. I\u0026rsquo;m very much a \u0026ldquo;slow and steady\u0026rdquo; kind of writer, and in a way I owe that self-knowledge to NaNo. Live and learn, though the lesson may be painful.\nThird, my experience with NaNo may also have been when I started to let go of the fantasy of having it all, and realized I couldn\u0026rsquo;t fill up all my time with work and then somehow cram writing in there as well. I would have to make room in my life for a writing practice, and that would entail real life changes, scary as they were. There were no shortcuts. I had to put in the time, effort, and commitment. Actually acting on this realization would take more time and effort, and is a story for another time.\nConclusion: Don\u0026rsquo;t look back in anger NaNo might not have worked for me and I will never do it in its full form again, but I learned from it and I wish good luck and good fun to the many thousands of writers who will be undertaking the challenge this coming November and afterward. I\u0026rsquo;ll be cheering from the sidelines, continuing in my own way and at my own pace.\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/nanowrimo-experience/","summary":"I crashed and burned on overachieving NaNoWriMo, but learned some valuable lessons from the experience.","title":"How NaNoWriMo Broke me, and What I Learned from the Experience"},{"content":"Originally posted on Mastodon on September 8, 2020.\n唧唧復唧唧，木蘭當戶織。不聞機杼聲，惟聞女嘆息。\nHark to the sound of murmurs fill the room;\nMulan before the door does toil at loom.\nThe shuttle slacks; the clacking silent falls,\nThe only sound the maid's lamenting call.\n問女何所思，問女何所憶。女亦無所思，女亦無所憶。\nYou wonder where the maiden's thoughts may bend,\nWhat memory might her give such sweet torment.\nYet no phantasm grips her sturdy heart,\nNor does remembrance cause her aught of doubt.\n昨夜見軍帖，可汗大點兵，軍書十二卷，卷卷有爺名。\nPast eve were seen the martial rosters grand;\nThe Khan calls forth a muster 'cross the land.\nThe names march onward far as you can look,\nAnd Father's name is found in every book.\n阿爺無大兒，木蘭無長兄，願爲市鞍馬，從此替爺徵。\nThere's no grown son to stand in Father's stead;\nNo brother rides so she may rest her head.\nAt market will she buy her horse and gear,\nAnd take her Father's place wherefore to serve.\n東市買駿馬，西市買鞍韉，南市買轡頭，北市買長鞭。\nEastward she goes, the finest horse to buy;\nWestward she goes for saddle fit to fly.\nSouthward she goes for bridle and a rein,\nNorthward she goes; a riding crop is gained.\n旦辭爺孃去，暮宿黃河邊，不聞爺孃喚女聲，但聞黃河流水鳴濺濺。\nAt morning blush she rides, by parents blessed;\nAt nighttime dark by Yellow River slept.\nNo longer does she hear her parents' call,\nOnly the mighty water crash and fall.\n旦辭黃河去，暮至黑山頭，不聞爺孃喚女聲，但聞燕山胡騎鳴啾啾。\nShe rides at dawn, the river at her back;\nEncamp'd by night at the feet of Mountains Black.\nNo longer does she hear her parents' voice,\nOnly the savage horsemen's screaming noise.\n萬里赴戎機，關山度若飛。朔氣傳金柝，寒光照鐵衣。將軍百戰死，壯士十年歸。\nMachines of war a thousand leagues do blaze,\nFly past the strongholds, 'cross the mountain ways.\nThe frigid wind resounds with striking steel;\nA frozen light is burnt on coats of mail.\nA hundred battles fought, and many fall;\nA decade's strife finds some still standing tall.\n歸來見天子，天子坐明堂。策勳十二轉，賞賜百千強。\nThey come before the Son of Heaven high\nWho sits in glory on the throne of light.\nBy all reports, courageous deeds were done;\nReward is given, just and princely sums.\n可汗問所欲，木蘭不用尚書郎，願馳千里足，送兒還故鄉。\nThe Khan inquires, aught else does she desire?\nMulan thinks not of office nor of honor,\nHer only wish to ride a thousand miles\nBound for the much-loved home where she would dwell.\n爺孃聞女來，出郭相扶將；阿姊聞妹來，當戶理紅妝；小弟聞姊來，磨刀霍霍向豬羊。\nHer parents head outside the city gates;\nClinging to one another, they but wait.\nBig Sister, told Mulan will soon be there,\nPuts on her dress and make-up with some care.\nThe Little Brother, welcome feast to roast,\nSharpens the knives and hurries to the goats.\n開我東閣門，坐我西閣牀，脫我戰時袍，著我舊時裳。當窗理雲鬢，對鏡貼花黃。\n\"Eastward I open up the bower door;\nWestward I sit upon my platform chair.\nThe long, grim cloak of war do I cast off;\nThe skirt of girlhood I put on with love.\nBy window clear I fix my cloud-soft hair;\nIn mirror bright affix the flowers fair.\"\n出門看火伴，火伴皆驚忙：同行十二年，不知木蘭是女郎。\nOutside she steps to meet her comrades' eyes,\nAnd to a man they start in their surprise.\nA decade on, they've been through thick and thin;\nIn all this time they never dreamed Mulan was not a man!\n雄兔腳撲朔，雌兔眼迷離；雙兔傍地走，安能辨我是雄雌？\n\"When held, a rabbit male will kick its feet,\nWhile rabbit female looks through eyes that slit.\nWhen they run close to ground and side by side\nFemale or male am I, can you decide?\"\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/ballad-of-mulan/","summary":"The long, grim cloak of war do I cast off / The skirt of girlhood I put on with love.","title":"The Ballad of Mulan"},{"content":"I had a lot of fun playing the indie game Carto (2020), an innovative and enjoyable puzzle game where you put map pieces together, changing in-game reality itself to overcome obstacles and help reunite our heroine Carto and her grandmother. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I could add much to what has already been said about its gameplay and narrative, and there\u0026rsquo;s a good selection of reviews linked from the game\u0026rsquo;s Metacritic page.\nWhat I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen discussed as much is that the titular protagonist Carto appears to be a nonspeaking person, or one who only occasionally speaks. Though reviews like this one or this one alluded to her silence, they generally put it down to her being quiet or shy. Carto may be quiet, but shy? Nah. There\u0026rsquo;s no reason to discount neurodivergence as an explanation and here\u0026rsquo;s my case for it.\nSPOILER WARNING: The rest of this post contains spoilers about the world and story of the game Carto.\nA smile is worth a thousand words :-) From the first I found it slightly odd that Carto\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;dialogue\u0026rdquo; was represented by emojis, most commonly the smile emoji :-) accompanied by her sprite representation smiling. Every other character\u0026rsquo;s lines were represented by actual words, after all. She also did not seem to be deaf, since she understood when other characters addressed her in spoken language.\nI was excited at the thought that Carto might be hearing but nonspeaking, since my son is mostly nonspeaking and I\u0026rsquo;m always thrilled at good autistic representation in media. Still, I thought the emojis could be an abstraction of Carto\u0026rsquo;s lines rather than a literal depiction so I didn\u0026rsquo;t get my hopes up too much. There was so much else to enjoy about the game, after all.\nUndoubted confirmation came toward the end of the game, like a gift. When Carto finally meets up with her grandmother, her best friend Shianan jokes about not hearing much about the grandmother because Carto is so quiet.\nIt looks like Shianan could have heard a lot about Grandma if she\u0026rsquo;d had time to learn sign language, though, because Grandma\u0026rsquo;s last letter prior to the meeting has a sketch of her and Carto signing to each other.\nCarto also speaks a little toward the end, mostly names\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;Grandma!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Carto and Shianan!\u0026rdquo; and so on, showing that her earlier emoji-talk was not an abstraction but actual representations of facial expressions without spoken words.\nSo there you have it, Carto is a hearing and nonspeaking or minimally speaking character who speaks primarily in sign language. She seems to have little trouble with verbal comprehension or writing, the latter seen in a letter she sends Shianan in the epilogue.\nIt was such a rare case of a nonspeaking character, the main character at that, shown in a way that\u0026rsquo;s not left open for interpretation or headcanons but made explicitly clear as canon. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to express the depth of my appreciation for this, except maybe by writing a giant review and shoutout post on that one subject I guess.\nNo big deal, because it isn\u0026rsquo;t Something else I found refreshing is that Carto\u0026rsquo;s being nonspeaking is no big deal at all to the other characters. Shianan mentions it once, as discussed above, in a gently teasing/apologetic way after she and Carto have become good friends. Otherwise, the characters Carto comes across don\u0026rsquo;t bring it up, interacting without making a fuss when Carto communicates nonverbally, such as by signing or showing \u0026ldquo;sand\u0026rdquo; to them when she wants directions to the desert.\nOne moment of respectful but casual accommodation that comes to mind is when Carto was at the volcano hotel1 rebooting their water heating system. The machinery is accessible by climbing a rope down a pit, and one of the hotel\u0026rsquo;s proprietors remains at the top while Carto climbs down. When Carto reaches the boiler room at the bottom, the proprietor calls out to her to pull on the rope when she wants to climb back up.\nThis left an impression because the two characters are never out of shouting distance from each other, and the proprietor guides Carto through the ultimately disastrous reboot sequence by vocal instruction. The proprietor, in other words, noticed Carto doesn\u0026rsquo;t speak and made no comment about it, but opted to give her the instruction to pull on the rope rather than shout, accommodating the lack of vocal communication.\nIn a better world this is how all accommodation would happen, respectfully and with minimal comment. In an even better world hotel proprietors would also not send guests into dangerous locations to do their repair work. But we can\u0026rsquo;t have everything now, can we?\nMaybe one reason the characters find Carto\u0026rsquo;s neurodivergence entirely unremarkable is that the world of the game is itself diverse, with many different ways of life coexisting. Carto\u0026rsquo;s own clan fly all around the world on blimps. We start her in-game adventures on an island where no one comes back home after leaving as a teenager. Later we move on to a forest where people grow huge beards, have animal companions, and one chosen person guards a giant growing tree for decades, away from human settlements.\nAgainst this backdrop a girl who doesn\u0026rsquo;t speak is positively ordinary, and whether the reasons are neurological, cultural, or otherwise it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be considered anyone else\u0026rsquo;s business. Is she physically or neurologically unable to speak? Does she not speak the local language? Did she take a vow of silence? Who knows, and what does it matter?\nCultural diversity leading to neurodivergence acceptance makes sense to me because neurotype normativity is just one of the many pressures for conformity that form the basis of bigotry in our world. This kind of coexistence between vastly different peoples is a fascinating aspect of Carto\u0026rsquo;s world.\nI guess there should be a conclusion Carto is a great little game that puzzle game lovers are likely to enjoy, one with a straightforward and entertaining story. It may also enhance your enjoyment that the hero of the game is a nonspeaking and, to my mind, autistic girl who enjoys full respect from the people around her, who is at no point seen as an aberration or tragedy.\nNeedless to say, I highly recommend the game. It\u0026rsquo;s fun and a little different, like Carto herself.\nIs anyone going to talk about how the volcano stage contains homage to Legend of Kyrandia 2: The Hand of Fate, much like the icebergs stage does for Tetris?\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/carto-game-nonspeaking/","summary":"The heroine of the indie game Carto is a nonspeaking girl, and it\u0026rsquo;s neither tragic nor remarkable.","title":"The Heroine of the Game Carto Is Nonspeaking (and It's Totally Cool)"},{"content":"Hey Arch Linux user!\nDo you keep getting 404 errors when you try to install packages? Did you rewrite your /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist file for what feels like dozens of times? Did you edit your /etc/pacman.conf file according to this Stack Exchange and forum post or that, hoping to get things to work?\nIf so, these tips just might help. That\u0026rsquo;s where I was, to the point of almost ragequitting Arch altogether, but trying these tips helped.\nUpdate the package database If you have your mirrorlist file arranged so the ones geographically closer to you are on top, it may be that you need to update your database. You might want to try updating your package database with:\n$ sudo pacman -Sy Or you could do a full system upgrade with -Syu, your choice. This landed me in dependency hell, though, see below, so I opted for just a database update this time around and it worked for me.\nThe reason 404 errors are common in Arch, according to a forum post I saw, is that old packages are deleted on the servers. Therefore, if your package database is outdated pacman will ask for old deleted versions of packages, resulting in 404 errors.\nLive and learn, right?\nThe next level: Dependency hell After updating the database Arch finally seemed ready to start installing packages again, but this time I fell into the dread\u0026hellip; dependency hell. It consisted of messages like this:\n:: poppler(21.07.0-1) 설치로 의존성 \u0026#39;poppler=21.06.1\u0026#39;(poppler-glib가 요구)가 깨집니다 Which, translated into English, means that the package I was trying to install (kdenlive) required I upgrade poppler to version 21.07.0-1, which would break the dependency of poppler-glib on version 21.06.1. Evidenly this would ultimately lead to a dependency breakage of Gnu Image Manipulation Program via gegl\u0026rsquo;s dependency on that specific version of poppler-glib.\nRunning the install command with --ignore poppler didn\u0026rsquo;t help, since pacman refused to install without the poppler upgrade. Nor did trying to install with sudo pacman -Sdd kdenlive help, since this resulted in kdenlive installing without any dependencies and the package simply did not work.\nSo what I did was upgrade the offending dependency by itself, which was feasible in my case because there was just one, specifying a -d switch so the dependency version check was ignored:\n$ sudo pacman -Sd poppler When I tried the kdenlive installation again it worked, and luckily the Image Manipulation Program wasn\u0026rsquo;t broken by the poppler upgrade. It very well could have been, though, since upgrades to dependencies do cause breakages. That\u0026rsquo;s why dependency version checks exist in the first place.\nBy ignoring dependency version checks, therefore, you do assume the risk of dependency breakages causing malfunctions, which is a long-running issue in the open source world. Arch Linux, in particular, only allows one version of each package, raising the risk of dependency breakages\u0026ndash;not a good combination with its fast-moving updates.\nIt should also be noted that running the kdenlive install with one -d switch instead of two might have had a similar result as installing the dependency package with -d, maybe in conjunction with --ignore poppler. According to man pacman one -d switch just ignores dependency version checks while repeating it twice like I did ignores all dependencies, which in this case meant the app wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nKeep Arching on\u0026hellip; or not I don\u0026rsquo;t claim these tips will solve every problem with the Arch package manager, but they could be helpful if your mirrorlist seems more or less in order yet all mirrors are failing with 404 errors. And if dependency conflicts are tying up your package installations and system updates after the 404 errors are resolved, the second part of the advice would come into play. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want the risk of broken dependencies, or if ignoring dependencies result in apps breaking, you should file a bug report with the relevant projects.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also a valid choice to decide that maybe Arch Linux isn\u0026rsquo;t for you if you find these issues to be too much trouble. Arch is a purposefully fast-moving distribution and by design requires a level of expertise or at least bloody-mindedness. There are user-friendlier Arch-based distributions like Manjaro that stay a little behind the development curve and are said to be more stable as a result. The price is in staler packages than mainline Arch, but it\u0026rsquo;s my understanding packages are still newer than in something like Debian. Besides, truly cutting-edge users don\u0026rsquo;t find even Arch packages new enough and turn to the Arch User Repository for development versions or compile directly from project Git repos.\nIn the end you have to decide how important newer packages and upgrades are to you, and how much hassle you\u0026rsquo;re willing to put up with. If you want to keep going with Arch Linux, hopefully this post is helpful to you.\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/arch-linux-404-dependency/","summary":"Update the package database and manually resolve dependencies.","title":"Resolving Arch Linux 404 and Dependency Errors"},{"content":"獨笑\nLaughing Alone\n有粟無人食\nThe stores are full without a child to feed;\n多男必患飢\nHunger does rule the home with many sons.\n達官必憃愚\nThe man of office high is but a fool,\n才者無所施\nWhile talent true will languish quite unknown.\n家室少完福\nRare is the home that knows of total bliss;\n至道常陵遲\nVirtue up high will to the grave be gone.\n翁嗇子每蕩\nWhat parents thrifted children\u0026rsquo;s hands do waste,\n婦慧郎必癡\nThe woman wise is tripped by feckless man.\n月滿頻値雲\nOn full moon nights the clouds get in the way;\n花開風誤之\nFlowers in bloom are struck by straying winds.\n物物盡如此\nThis is but how the world goes all the time,\n獨笑無人知\nAlone I laugh, and none do understand!\n\u0026mdash; 茶山 丁若鏞\nDasan Jeong Yak-yong (1762-1836), Korean bureaucrat, scholar, author, poet, philosopher, scientist, and engineer.\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/laughing-alone/","summary":"This is but how the world goes all the time / Alone I laugh, and none do understand!","title":"Laughing Alone (獨笑)"},{"content":"Narcissists have a bad reputation, to put it mildly. More and more \u0026ldquo;narcissist\u0026rdquo; seems to be used interchangeably with \u0026ldquo;abuser,\u0026rdquo; with terms like \u0026ldquo;narcissistic abuse\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;narcissistic parenting\u0026rdquo; in common use. Armchair diagnoses and labelling are common on threads about abusive behavior.\nThis is, needless to say, tremendously stigmatizing to people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), and doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it any easier for people to seek help with a disorder that is already said to be resistant to treatment. As others have pointed out, no other mental disorder is intrinsically linked in people\u0026rsquo;s minds to being an abuser as NPD is, except perhaps borderline personality disorder (BPD) and the so-called antisocial personality disorders. Even these other massively armchair-diagnosed and stigmatized disorders, however, are not automatically associated with abuse the way NPD is: \u0026ldquo;Borderline abuse\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;psychopathic/sociopathic abuse\u0026rdquo; have not entered the popular vernacular the way \u0026ldquo;narcissistic abuse\u0026rdquo; has.\nWhat I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do, obviously, is dismiss the specific concerns and issues arising from being abused by people with narcissistic traits. An abuser\u0026rsquo;s narcissistic traits, like any other trait of abusers, can cause distinct issues in victims and survivors. These are absolutely issues that should be discussed and researched, and the last thing I want to do is silence survivors or take away the language they need to understand and heal. This is all the more because I was myself abused by someone with strong narcissistic tendencies, such as preoccupation with success and perfection and expectation of special treatment, and I\u0026rsquo;m still unpacking the impact this left on me.\nMy problem with \u0026ldquo;narcissistic abuse\u0026rdquo; as a term is that it is extremely stigmatizing against people with NPD while its utility to survivors seems limited. The term is flawed by inaccurate and overbroad thinking about narcissism and demonization of narcissistic traits. It also places the focus on the abuser\u0026rsquo;s characteristics and speculative or real diagnosis, and not on the effects on the survivor. I know I have issues from the inordinate expectations placed on me by someone who saw me as an extension of the self to fulfill some fantasy of glory, and who treated any negative reactions on my part as a personal affront. Are these issues distinct to being abused by someone with narcissistic traits? Are they distinct enough to be separated from abuse in general? Or is the distinction meaningless because ALL abuse is actually narcissistic in nature?\nThis lack of clarity about the definitional boundaries and implications of \u0026ldquo;narcissistic abuse\u0026rdquo; makes it not so much a diagnostic criterion or resource for survivors as a snarled insult, an expression of rage toward a poorly-defined group rather than a means to confront and heal. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, the rage of victims is absolutely necessary and can be a powerful force. However, this is rage at a group of people that may or may not include the actual abusers but certainly does include people who are not toxic or abusive, and whose mental illness is moralized and conflated with toxicity EXACTLY as we know we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t for just about any other mental illness.\nThe way \u0026ldquo;narcissistic\u0026rdquo; has been turned into a synonym for \u0026ldquo;abusive\u0026rdquo; also means that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to conceive of non-abusive narcissistic people, far less narcissistic people as victims. Even though people with narcissistic traits, up to full-blown NPD, have clear vulnerabilities to abuse due to their sense of emptiness and hunger for validation, when narcissism and abuse come up it\u0026rsquo;s exclusively about narcissists as the perpetrators.\nTo the extent we accept that narcissistic traits may make a person likelier to be abusive, the lack of resources on preventing and managing such risks as a narcissistic person is striking. It\u0026rsquo;s as though narcissistic people as a class, not just the ones who are toxic/abusive, have been written off as unworthy of protection and unable or unwilling to make choices to be better. This is what dehumanization looks like.\nIs this what the classification of \u0026ldquo;narcissistic abuse,\u0026rdquo; and the discourse surrounding narcissism in general, are meant to achieve? To provide no meaningful guidance to victims whose abusers have narcissistic tendencies beyond what could be achieved by simply calling it abuse, while demonizing a whole class of mentally ill people as inherently toxic and evil? Then what\u0026rsquo;s the use of it? Where\u0026rsquo;s the reason to continue using it?\nAgain, and I want to make this clear, I believe there are potential uses in delving into the characteristics of abusers and the circumstances of abuse. Spiritual abuse gives rise to distinct issues, for instance, as do financial, physical, sexual, verbal, and emotional abuse. Parental abuse, sibling abuse, workplace abuse, and peer abuse can all be very different from each other. An abuser with narcissistic tendencies might similarly cause distinct issues that survivors must navigate.\nA lot more clarity is required, however, for the categorization to be useful to survivors without being stigmatizing to people with NPD. I suspect it\u0026rsquo;ll have to be broken down much more than simply \u0026ldquo;narcissistic,\u0026rdquo; too, such as the reality-warping effect of being made to participate in overinflated fantasies, or living with the onus of perfection to fulfill the abuser\u0026rsquo;s preoccupations. I equally suspect that many of the things people call narcissistic abuse are just plain entitlement that can arise with all kinds of pathologies and not just NPD, or the lack of any pathology at all.\nThere is great emotional power in having an Other to rail against, and clarity in having one answer, like narcissism, for everything. When the chosen target is wrong, however, and the answer is inaccurate, we end up doing harm to others and ourselves. The way things stand now, \u0026ldquo;narcissistic abuse\u0026rdquo; is one of those inaccurate and harmful categories. It\u0026rsquo;s time to retire it and do better.\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/questioning-narcissistic-abuse/","summary":"\u0026lsquo;Narcissistic abuse\u0026rsquo; as a term is extremely stigmatizing to people with NPD while its utility to survivors seems limited.","title":"  Is \"Narcissistic Abuse\" a Useful Term?\n  "},{"content":" 龍可豢 非眞龍 虎可搏 非眞虎\n故 爵祿可餌榮進之輩 必不可籠淡然無欲之人\n鼎鑊可及寵利之流 必不可加飄然引之士\n\u0026mdash; 菜根譚 四. 閒適篇 一\nThe dragon that may be penned in is no true dragon.\nThe tiger that may be bound is no true tiger.\nTherefore, though positions and riches may make underlings out of the ambitious,\nsuch bait can never cage a person of simple tastes free of greed.\nPunishment and tortures may reach those who wish for fame and fortune,\nbut can never affect those who are free as the wind.\n\u0026mdash; Words from Lean Times1 Part 4: A Composed Life, 1.\nA self-help book from the Ming dynasty of China combining elements of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/no-true-dragon/","summary":"The dragon that can be penned in is no true dragon.","title":"No True Dragon (非眞龍)"},{"content":" 風來疎竹 風過而竹不留聲,\n鴈度寒潭 鴈去而潭不留影,\n故君孑事來而心始現 事去而心隨空.\n\u0026mdash; 菜根譚\nThough wind blows through the bamboo sparse,\nWhen it has passed the wood does not the sound retain.\nWild goose flies o\u0026rsquo;er the cold clear lake;\nThe flying shape does not on water long remain.\nThusly, the thought arises in the man of virtue when th\u0026rsquo;occasion calls;\nWhen it has passed the mind again must turn serene.\n\u0026mdash; Words from Lean Times1\nA self-help book from the Ming dynasty of China combining elements of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/wind-bamboo-sparse/","summary":"Though wind blows through the bamboo sparse / When it has passed the wood does not the sound retain.","title":"Wind Blows Through the Bamboo Sparse (風來疎竹)"},{"content":"From time to time I\u0026rsquo;m asked, perhaps especially as a non-dev who uses Emacs every day, how I got into what is considered development software and one seen as esoteric and antiquated at that. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about my experience with Emacs and the advice I would personally give to people who are thinking of getting into it.\nDestination: Emacs It probably helped lead me to Emacs that I\u0026rsquo;ve been a hobby coder for decades and like to fiddle with computers. I\u0026rsquo;m known as the tech person in my family, and have written small apps in Python 2 including an IRC dicebot in the 00\u0026rsquo;s. (Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m That old.) I\u0026rsquo;ve used PHP and MySQL to run hosted blogs; I\u0026rsquo;ve tried Ubuntu and now use an Arch Linux installation daily. Coding and computers don\u0026rsquo;t scare me, and what I lack in expertise and training I make up for in sheer determination and willingness to pour countless hours into solving a problem (thanks, ADHD hyperfocus!!). So in a way a developer\u0026rsquo;s tool like Emacs was a natural fit for me.\nEven so, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would have bothered with something as complex as Emacs if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for my growing discontentment with the software I used in my writing. LibreOffice was and is my favorite word processor but still, it\u0026rsquo;s a word processor. They have their uses and are necessary for my work, but the mix of formatting and content was constraining for first drafts, and the completely linear treatment of the text did not lend itself to flexible thinking about the text and content. Ultimately, in my workflow, word processors are for presenting text, not creating it.\nScrivener was great while it lasted. At the time it was a completely new paradigm of writing software for me, with the ability to make text modular and to rearrange it, and snapshots as a rudimentary form of version control. Still, it too had its problems. The lack of certain functions like mobile editing, good collaboration support, and portable files became increasingly glaring. The last straw came when I was locked out of software I had paid for\u0026ndash;twice, on Windows and later Macbook!\u0026ndash;due to the company\u0026rsquo;s server problems. Shortly afterward I moved to Linux for the reasons discussed in my Linux Setup submission, and using Scrivener became a moot point anyway. Years of experience with Scrivener did give me a better idea of what I wanted in a piece of writing software, however: Separation of content and presentation, version control, and the ability to move pieces of text around and edit them individually. I also wanted them in a form that couldn\u0026rsquo;t be arbitrarily locked down, corrupted, or otherwise made inaccessible.\nObviously, I learned over time that the things I wanted were doable by editing in plain text formats. I looked around for plaintext editing options that would also allow for making text modular. LaTeX was in serious running for a while and I even read a book about it before deciding it wasn\u0026rsquo;t right for me and my non-technical use-case. AsciiDoc was great and I worked on a fair number of projects with it writing on Vim, which was when I completely fell in love with Vim\u0026rsquo;s editing capabilities. The modular treatment of text was incomplete at best under this format and software combination, however.\nI thought about writing an Atom plugin or even writing a text editor myself to get the functions I wanted\u0026ndash;yeah, that would have gone well lol\u0026ndash;before, as so many do, I found out about Emacs and Org Mode. (Update 2022-10-22: And, of course, GitHub has since pulled the plug on Atom while Emacs is still going as it has for decades before Atom ever existed.) Through my research I learned Org had everything I was looking for, could be exported to a bunch of other formats, and that it emulated Vim commands through Evil Mode. Sold, sold, and sold. I decided to make the jump. I installed Emacs and very slowly started trying things on it and learning the ropes.\nBuilding up my Emacs configuration It took me a while to \u0026ldquo;warm up\u0026rdquo; to real configuration work on Emacs. I used it intermittently for months with the default splash screen enabled (cringe!), learning basic commands. I did the built-in tutorial, read or watched some guides like this amazing talk by Org Mode creator Carsten Dominik, and tried to get used to the interface when I had spare time.\nAt first I didn\u0026rsquo;t even install Evil Mode despite not liking the default Emacs movement keys at all. For one thing I hadn\u0026rsquo;t figured out the package system yet, and even though it was always the plan to install Evil Mode and its availability was one reason I made the jump from Vim to Emacs, I wanted to give the native Emacs commands a fair shake and at least learn the basics.\nI slowly got into things like Org Mode, using the most basic functions which were more than enough at first when I was still new to it. As Carsten Dominik put it, that\u0026rsquo;s a great thing about Org, that you can start as simply as you like and work your way up to as much or as little complexity as you need.\nIt was only after months of having at least a shaky grasp of basic Emacs functions that I started doing things like configuring visuals and adding packages, spurred on in part by the Emacs from Scratch videos on the System Crafters channel that was just taking off at the time. I didn\u0026rsquo; use even a fraction of the advice given on that channel, though. Instead I mostly used the videos as inspiration and a jumping-off point for more research on how to do specific things when I saw the host doing stuff I wanted for my own setup.\nSatisfied Mode Since then I\u0026rsquo;ve read two books about Emacs, Learning Gnu Emacs and Mastering Emacs. I found them engaging reads that taught me a lot more about how Emacs works. I have also been intermittently reading the Org Mode Manual, from which I learned a lot of little tricks to make Org more versatile and convenient for me.\nBetween this and a lot of things I found out through YouTube, Reddit, and online friends, my init.el has grown to a little over 300 lines. That\u0026rsquo;s tiny in comparison to Emacs veterans, of course, but is in keeping with my motto, as they say, to move slow and fix things. I\u0026rsquo;m not technically ambitious or highly skilled; I just want a tool that works more or less how I want it to and doesn\u0026rsquo;t require my data to be sent to a company, one that would not stop being supported because it\u0026rsquo;s no longer profitable. GNU Emacs, configured little by little entirely at my own pace and actively developed for decades by a worldwide team of maintainers and contributors, exactly fits that bill.\nThe good news is, that means you can use Emacs too as someone who isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily technologically proficient and just wants a stable working environment, if you don\u0026rsquo;t mind a slow pace and some work including a little coding.\nGeneral advice My best advice based on personal experience? Don\u0026rsquo;t rush it!\nEmacs can seem big and intimidating if you want to learn the ins and outs and to customize it to your exact needs, and honestly it is intimidating and time-consuming to do all that.\nIt becomes more manageable, though, when you start simple and go slowly. Add configurations and packages as you feel the need and as you become more comfortable with the platform and Emacs Lisp, the language of Emacs.\nGoing step by step, breaking and then fixing things as you go, will help you understand your configuration and learn with it. It\u0026rsquo;ll make the dreaded \u0026ldquo;.emacs bankruptcy\u0026rdquo; where your configuration breaks beyond repair less likely, both because your configuration will be easier to debug when it changes in increments and because you understand what went into it.\nI guess the above tips my hand on the \u0026ldquo;vanilla or packaged distro\u0026rdquo; issue, too. By packaged distros I mean distributions like Doom Emacs or Space Emacs that come with a lot of configurations out of the box, with Vim-style keybindings in the case of both Doom and Space Emacs.\nTo be clear, I\u0026rsquo;m not about to tell anyone not to get an Emacs distro. They do cool stuff at only a fraction of the time and effort of setting up vanilla Emacs, and I can see why they\u0026rsquo;re popular. If spending a lot of painstaking effort on configurations isn\u0026rsquo;t your thing and a distro looks right for you, by all means go for it.\nThat said, I would not install a distro myself because I\u0026rsquo;ve heard stories of the codebase breaking or no longer being supported in some environments. This is not the kind of risk I\u0026rsquo;m willing to take, to lose an entire working environment I\u0026rsquo;ve come to rely on with no practical way to get it back. For me vanilla GNU Emacs, configured by my hand, is much more versatile and easier to repair in case something breaks or changes.\nDistros are a valid choice depending on your personal balance of stability versus convenience. I just happen to fall more on the stability side of things, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt that I actually like to spend time on configurations because I find them fun to do, in reasonable doses.\nAbove all, I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll have fun with it! Emacs is a practical and powerful platform, but it can also be a deeply personal project that is molded to you and changes according to your needs, preferences, and growing skill. Emacs is my main software for writing, my file manager, my task and schedule manager, my email program, my main git interface\u0026hellip; so much of my life is tied into it. It\u0026rsquo;s an experience like no other I\u0026rsquo;ve had with software and can be a rollercoaster of excitement for the new, the comfort of the familiar, and, I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, bouts of hair-tearing frustration. There\u0026rsquo;s also the good, solid satisfaction of crafting a tool you use daily with your own hands, piece by piece. You can make it uniquely yours if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to put in the work. That may be the true gift of Emacs, the ability to make it your own in every sense.\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/how-i-got-into-emacs/","summary":"The true gift of Emacs may be the ability to make it your own in every sense.","title":"How I Got into Emacs"},{"content":"The computer wasn\u0026rsquo;t connecting to the internet this morning with the nm-applet on the status bar saying network connections were unusable.

Pansori is a Korean musical form developed from around the 17th century, where one person sings and makes commentary following a set story to the accompaniment of a drummer.\nThere are five traditional repertoires that have survived to the present day: Chunhyangga (The Song of Chunhyang), Shimcheongga (The Song of Shim Cheong), Sugungga (The Song of the Sea Palace), Jeokbyeokga (The Song of the Red Cliffs), and Heungboga (The Song of Heungbo). In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll be discussing some of the story elements of Chunhyangga, Shimcheongga, and Sugungga.\nContent warning: The sections below contain discussions of dark subject matter including violence, death, and poverty. More detailed warnings are given by section.\nChunhyangga: A love story of self-determination and respect Content warning: Attempted sexual coercion, imprisonment, torture\nChunhyangga is the love story of teenagers Seong Chunhyang, who is the daughter of a retired gisaeng (courtesan), and Yi Mongryong, the son of a noble family. Theirs are most certainly not two households both alike in dignity; in patriarchal and class-stratified Joseon Dynasty terms Chunhyang does not even have a house worth the name, for she has no father and the head of her family is a woman once indentured to the state to provide entertainment services. Although Chunhyang\u0026rsquo;s mother Wolmae retired in success and relative wealth and is no longer bound to be a courtesan, nor is Chunhyang herself formally a courtesan, her low birth still makes her vulnerable to abuse of power as the story will demonstrate.\nChunhyang and Mongryong meet and fall in love when Mongryong\u0026rsquo;s father is appointed the governor of fair Namwon, where we lay our scene, a real town in Korea and a holy site to the art of pansori to this day. Smitten, the two 16-year-olds declare themselves man and wife but their union cannot possibly be officially recognized due to the gaping chasm between their stations. In Joseon, a kingdom whose founding order depended on a strict social hierarchy, at best Chunhyang could be Mongryong\u0026rsquo;s concubine if he cared enough to keep her around.\nThe first calamity strikes our young lovers when Mongryong\u0026rsquo;s father is called away to Hanyang (present-day Seoul) where Chunhyang cannot follow because, again, she was not a legally sanctioned wife. Mongryong might have been able to take her with him if he were respectably married to a noblewoman and was the head of his own household, but as an officially unmarried boy he was part of his father\u0026rsquo;s household and had to go where his father went. The two part tearfully, promising to be faithful to each other, and Chunhyang begins her long wait for him, mourning their parting and hoping for him to return to her a successful man so that they can be together. In the terms of the times this meant passing the state examination and winning high office.\nThe second and even worse disaster strikes in the form of the man who succeeds Mongryong\u0026rsquo;s father as governor of Namwon: Byeon Hakdo. A corrupt and lustful man, he hears of Chunhyang\u0026rsquo;s famed beauty and just as famous virtue and commands her to attend to him as a courtesan. This, even though she is not on the courtesan register and is legally a free woman. She also considers herself married, to a nobleman at that, and will not pour drinks and smile for another man.\nNone of that is any protection against Byeon Hakdo\u0026rsquo;s abuse of power, however, and when Chunhyang continues to refuse him he has her imprisoned and beaten into unconsciousness. He imprisons her, declaring she would be put to death on his upcoming birthday for the crime of refusing him as a mere lowborn woman.\nIt is at this point, the night before Chunhyang\u0026rsquo;s scheduled execution, that the long-awaited Lee Mongryong returns to Namwon\u0026ndash;but at night, as a ragged itinerant whose once-proud house has fallen. Wolmae, on seeing him, screams that her daughter Chunhyang is dead, for her one last hope of salvation is gone.\nNevertheless, Mongryong convinces his mother-in-law to let him see Chunhyang in prison, and the lovers have a touching reunion scene where Chunhyang, injured, imprisoned, and waiting to die, declares he is her love no matter what the circumstance and defends him to her irate and grieving mother. All Chunhyang asks is that she be buried as Mongryong\u0026rsquo;s faithful wife on his family\u0026rsquo;s funerary grounds, his castoff clothes covering her in the coffin.\nMorning comes, and Chunhyang is dragged before the governor Byeon Hakdo to be executed. He tries one last time to get her to relent, offering to spare her life if she will do as he commands, and she refuses to the last. Just as she is about to be killed, the troops of the King\u0026rsquo;s Secret Inspector strike, arresting Byeon and his cronies. Chunhyang, saved from the executioner\u0026rsquo;s blade, comes face-to-face with the Inspector\u0026ndash;her self-declared husband Lee Mongryong, who had returned in disguise hiding his high office to root out Byeon\u0026rsquo;s abuses of power and to save her. She is given a special dispensation to marry him, not as his concubine but as his lawful noble wife, and her virtue is praised throughout the land.\nWithin the limitations of the time and society it arose from, then, Chunhyangga tells a deeply subversive, and of course fantastical and impossible, story of a lowborn woman daring to assert her own will, her own love and self-determination, in the face of power and have it legitimized by the broader society. These are revolutionary ideas, though the story they appear in fits them into terms friendly to the existing order.\nThough heavily mediated and limited by the patriarchal social system of the time, the themes of women\u0026rsquo;s sexual and romantic autonomy free of the bounds of class are unmistakable. Yes, obviously, it is not feminism as we recognize it for a woman\u0026rsquo;s sexual and romantic decisions to be validated only if she is a free woman recognized as a nobleman\u0026rsquo;s wife and guards her sexual loyalty with her literal life. But if we call privilege by its true name, that is the granting of full humanity, we get a glimpse at the idea behind Chunhyang\u0026rsquo;s story\u0026ndash;a woman\u0026rsquo;s yearning for respect as a person, which in the times she lived in and for her gender was only possible in partial form for a virtuous noblewoman.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that while the governor Byeon Hakdo\u0026rsquo;s downfall for his corruption and cruelty is a political and subversive plotline, it is focused and mediated through his coercion and violence against the heroine. The governor\u0026rsquo;s persecution of Chunhyang is the main dramatic reason we want him to fall, and we want Mongryong to succeed because he is the man Chunhyang loves and the key to saving her life.\nMisogynist violence, therefore, is not a side political issue in the story as it is often treated in real life. Violence against women is THE political issue the story gets the audience to care about. The governor is obviously corrupt and exploitative in numerous other ways, but it is his treatment of a lovestruck, brave, steadfast girl that brings his evil into full focus and gets us to root for this corrupt official\u0026rsquo;s downfall. This ties into the broader political subversiveness of pansori, which is outside the scope of this post but deserves mention as far as it touches on the theme of women\u0026rsquo;s humanity and worth.\nI will say that there is a parallel in the political subversiveness of pansori to the theme of women\u0026rsquo;s autonomy in that the political subversiveness also dovetails into the existing order by use of fantasy. In this case it\u0026rsquo;s the fantasy that the political order under the King is a force for good that ends injustice and corruption, saving victims like Chunhyang. This is not historical fact, of course, much as a courtesan\u0026rsquo;s daughter becoming a noble wife was impossible in real life. But again, this was a story told within the limitations of its times, often using fantastical elements to fit the events of the story into the worldview of the time.\nShimcheongga: A father as his daughter\u0026rsquo;s all-loving, all-giving caregiver Content warning: Bereavement, human sacrifice, poverty, societal misogyny, breasts and breastfeeding\nShimcheongga tells the story of Shim Cheong and her daughterly love for her father Shim Hak-gyu. The most famous part of the story is that Cheong sells herself as a human sacrifice so her father can afford a sizable donation to a Buddhist temple, a good deed that is promised to give her blind father his sight.\nThe love and devotion is hardly one way, however. The actual story of Cheong and her father begins with, well, her birth of course, but the joy is swiftly and devastatingly eclipsed by her mother\u0026rsquo;s death only a week later. Cheong\u0026rsquo;s mother Lady Gwak, a skilled seamstress, was the breadwinner of the family where Hak-gyu could not work due to his disability. The death of the wife meant economic disaster for the family, especially since the couple had plowed their fortune into tithes and offerings trying to conceive a child at past forty. With that fond dream realized, however, the tragedy of the new mother\u0026rsquo;s death meant the father and infant daughter were staring down the barrel of imminent destitution and starvation.\nFortunately the community come through for this vulnerable family, and interestingly it\u0026rsquo;s all women who are mentioned as helping them. Centuries before the availability of baby formula and without the money to hire a wet nurse, baby Cheong would have starved to death without breastmilk. When Hak-gyu goes out to the village well begging milk for his infant daughter, those of the village women who are lactating feed her themselves, saying they\u0026rsquo;d rather let their own children go hungry than this poor thing. Women with no milk give money, while women without money give rice. It is also the community who feed this father and daughter throughout her childhood and teenage years as they beg food which is freely given to them.\nShimcheongga, then, begins with the story of a widowed single father, disabled and destitute, doing everything he can to raise his daughter\u0026ndash;a daughter who was, in the terms of the time, a useless liability who would not be able to carry on his name or support him in his old age.\nThis point is actually foregrounded very early in the story, at Cheong\u0026rsquo;s birth when her mother is still healthy. Having had Cheong when the couple were both in their forties, Lady Gwak asks Hak-gyu if he isn\u0026rsquo;t aggrieved that the only child they\u0026rsquo;ll have is a girl. The overjoyed father answers, not at all! After all, Cheong can marry a good man and have sons who will support their maternal grandparents. While constrained by the imagination of a heavily sexist time, the story nevertheless foregrounds the contributions women make to the welfare of their aged parents.\nBesides, you can tell the conventional idea of girls being supposedly a burden is belied from the start of the story with Lady Gwak being the breadwinner of the household who supported her husband and, later, paid for the age\u0026rsquo;s equivalent of fertility treatments. Shim Cheong herself, at the age of ten, takes over the food-begging duties from her father at her own insistence and does better than him at it.\nShimcheongga, in other words, subverts gender roles with a father as his daughter\u0026rsquo;s primary caregiver, and by also showing women as economic actors with agency. Even more than that, it argues that women have inherent worth and are deserving of care and devotion through this story of a motherless girl who would have died without her father\u0026rsquo;s and her community\u0026rsquo;s loving care and generosity.\nSugungga: Rabbit, revolutionary. Content warning: Attempted sacrifice and mutilation, body gendering, genitals\nSugungga, the most satirical of the five classic repertoires, has a female protagonist (or villain, depending) in the sense of a female animal. In the story the Sea King falls ill and his trusted retainer, Terrapin, sets out to land to capture a rabbit whose liver the Sea King must eat in order to heal. After a mishap with calling a Tiger instead of a Rabbit, the Terrapin finally meets and tricks Rabbit to the Sea Palace, luring it with promises of high office and honors. At the Sea Palace the true purpose of the visit is revealed, and Rabbit is told it will be killed so the Sea King can be cured. But not to worry, it\u0026rsquo;ll be remembered and honored forever for its noble sacrifice!\nRabbit, instead of quaking in fear, claims it can live without a liver. In fact, it takes out its liver every moon! This happens to be one of the times Rabbit had its liver out, and it needs to go back to land to fetch the organ. As proof of this unlikely tale Rabbit points out that it has three holes down there\u0026ndash;one for pissing, one for crapping, and one to take its liver out and put it back. Rabbit claims it is happy to hand some of its liver over to the Sea King and enjoy the high honors he will bestow in exchange. The Sea King falls for this and Terrapin takes Rabbit back to land. Of course Rabbit, once safely back on hand, mocks Terrapin soundly for its gullibility and runs off.\nI mean the \u0026ldquo;three holes\u0026rdquo; part is a ruse that a crowd better versed in mammal anatomy would never have fallen for; it\u0026rsquo;s pretty obvious to a landbound audience what the \u0026ldquo;third hole\u0026rdquo; is for and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for taking out any liver. In this sense, the Terrapin\u0026rsquo;s misadventures with the Tiger early on comes across like foreshadowing, with most versions saying it escaped by biting the tiger\u0026rsquo;s balls. This symbolism rings all the truer because in Korean folktale Tiger and Rabbit are often contrasted as symbols of the foolishness of the powerful and the wisdom of the powerless. It would not be a stretch to read gender into that symbolism, with Tiger as a strong, aggressive man and Rabbit as a physically weak but witty woman.\nThe way Rabbit is tricked into almost being killed so the Sea King might live is also reminiscent of the way patriarchal systems, and in this case the Neo-Confucian hierarchy of this time, demand sacrifices of women. Given that \u0026ldquo;give out the liver and gallbladder\u0026rdquo; is a common Korean expression for being a doormat without boundaries or the courage to say no, the entire premise of the story reads as satire for what believing the promises of the powerful does to you: You\u0026rsquo;re promised honor and prestige, and end up losing your selfhood and your very life. Rabbit itself was lured by the false promises of patriarchy before it had a rude awakening of the system\u0026rsquo;s true nature, and had to use its wits to survive that situation.\nThe story in this reading seems to ask, are you really going to give away your liver to a system that benefits only powerful men, and consent to live as a corpse with no will of your own, \u0026ldquo;cherished\u0026rdquo; in loving memory not as a vital, living being but for how you were deceived and exploited? The story also exposes the true nature of hierarchies like the patriarchy, that they ultimately depend on taking people\u0026rsquo;s will and lives, deceiving them into bargains that serve none but the powerful.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a message so subversive that it could only be told in metaphor: Where Chunhyangga and Shimcheongga paid at least lip service to Confucian values including the beneficience of the King and familial piety, Sugungga, in the realm of talking animals and supernatural beings, fully took off the gloves and pilloried the sacred social values of the times.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also an interesting contrast to be drawn between Shim Cheong\u0026rsquo;s willingly becoming a human sacrifice for her father and Rabbit\u0026rsquo;s refusal to sacrifice for the Sea King. As discussed at length above, Cheong was giving her life for a father who had lovingly raised her in difficult circumstances, while Rabbit had no intention of dying for a king that it had no relationship with and who had no claim to its loyalty. Though both sacrifices might be laudable in the logic of the worlds they take place in, in the case of Sugungga it would have been a hollow virtue without any grounding in reciprocal and loving relationships. That difference gives us room to think about how virtues in a hierarchical social system can be connected to emotional values with resonance, ones that we might be able to expand on and adapt without keeping the whole oppressive structure.\nConclusion No one is suggesting that these stories about a woman willing to be executed to be loyal to an absent husband, another woman who dove to her death for her father, and talking animals in an underwater palace are the pinnacle of Western-style modern feminism. What they do show is that the recognition of female autonomy and worth existed in Korean society far before full contact with the U.S. and Europe, and these ideas were not new to Koreans nor given to us wholesale by the West. The specific expressions may differ, but the feminist yearnings, the desire of women to be recognized as fully human and live on our own terms, has always been there as seen in this small glimpse of Korean art. It\u0026rsquo;s a heritage worthy of rediscovery and interpretation as we look to exploring a myriad of different feminisms, each in our cultural, historical, and social contexts.\nThis is an edited and expanded version of a thread originally posted to Mastodon.\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/feminist-pansori/","summary":"Pansori, a musical form born in openly misogynistic 17th-century Korea, recognizes and celebrates the humanity and worth of women in culturally and historically specific ways.","title":"The Feminist Pansori"},{"content":"Recently I was amused to read that Andrew Lee, the claimed \u0026ldquo;Crown Prince of Korea,\u0026rdquo; took over the Freenode IRC network. I mean, not the part where he took over Freenode, of course, which is a shame and I hope users will find a better home if he can\u0026rsquo;t be removed.\nThe part that amused me was that he claimed to be the Crown Prince of Korea, because a) that title doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist anymore because neither Korea is a monarchy anymore\u0026ndash;or at least not the same monarchy, in the case of the North\u0026ndash;and b) to the extent it exists, it belongs to someone else entirely and Andrew Lee has no claim to it.\nWhy is that, and who is the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; Crown Prince of Korea? Dive down that rabbit hole with me if you like royal family trivia and/or history.\nAndrew Lee: The case for and against First of all, let\u0026rsquo;s look at Andrew Lee\u0026rsquo;s claim to this title. The claim is that Yi Seok, a grandson of Gojong who was the last king of Joseon and the first Emperor of the Daehan Empire, passed on the title to Lee in October of 2018. (\u0026ldquo;Lee\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Yi\u0026rdquo; are romanizations of the same Korean surname 이(李). I will use \u0026ldquo;Yi\u0026rdquo; for Korean names because it is the more modern and phonetically correct one. I will also put the surname first for Korean names.)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s true that Yi Seok is one of the grandsons of Emperor Gojong and a member of the royal family. He is not, however, in the direct line of the last Crown Prince of Korea, and therefore cannot pass the title on. It\u0026rsquo;s also been pointed out that Andrew Lee has never made clear what his family ties to Yi Seok or the Korean royal family are, and if he is not a member of the royal family he is not eligible for any royal title in the first place.\nThe real Crown Prince (sort of) So is there an actual Crown Prince of Korea? Well, technically, no. The last guy to hold the title died in 1970 and he lost the title itself in 1910 when Japan took over Korea, and it was never restored because the monarchy was abolished. The title of Crown Prince, in other words, has not existed in 110 years and the last person to hold it has been dead for over 50.\nBut also, sort-of kind-of, yes? While the former royal family, the Yi family from Jeonju, no longer holds political power in Korea (individuals might, of course, but due to being elected in their personal capacity and not by family affiliation), the eldest man in the direct line of the former Crown Prince is acknowledged as the head of the family and holds rites for the royal ancestors. His title is not Crown Prince, however, far less King, but the Rite-Giver (봉사자, 奉祀子) for the Daehan Royal Family. As the former royal family they\u0026rsquo;ve decided to recognize the royal line and pay respects to the old kings, a millennia-old tradition in cases where a royal family that lost power survives.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a strictly private title, of course, and has nothing to do with official government designation or power. The Jeonju Yi family as a private association could call a dancing monkey their Rite-Giver and would be perfectly within their legal rights to do so. They could also call the monkey (or anyone they chose) the Crown Prince and it would be as legal as it is officially meaningless, much like Andrew Lee\u0026rsquo;s title.\nThe head of the former royal family and their Rite-Giver is not a monkey.\nNor is it Yi Seok or Andrew Lee.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s this guy:\nFigure 1: Yi Won\nThis is Yi Won, great-grandson of Gojong and grandson of Yi Eun, the aforementioned last Crown Prince of Korea. Or, if you go by legally recognized terms, the grandson of Yi Gang, Yi Eun\u0026rsquo;s brother. I told you this was a rabbit hole.\n\u0026hellip;Why? But wait, didn\u0026rsquo;t I say Yi Seok is a son of Yi Gang, making him Yi Won\u0026rsquo;s uncle? So why is Yi Won ahead of him in the family\u0026rsquo;s pecking order? Also what\u0026rsquo;s this about Yi Won having two different grandfathers?\nThis all goes back to the three sons of Gojong, who was the 26th king of Joseon and first Emperor of the Daehan Empire. Gojong\u0026rsquo;s eldest surviving son Cheok became Sunjong, the second and soon last Emperor when Japan took over the country in 1910. Sunjong had no son, so his Crown Prince was his younger half-brother Yi Eun, the last person to hold this title.\nThese two princes\u0026rsquo; half-brother, Yi Gang, had a whopping 21 children. The 10th son is Yi Seok while the 9th son, Yi Gab, had two sons and a daughter, the eldest son being Yi Won.\nHere comes the family tree, a vastly simplified one of course that omits everyone who is not directly mentioned in this particular story (siblings arranged left to right in birth order):\nFigure 2: A pared-down Korean royal family tree\nSo the first reason Yi Won has more seniority than Yi Seok and gets to be the head of the royal family is that while Yi Seok is older, Yi Won is the son of the older brother and that makes him more senior by direct line.\nThe more important reason, though, is that he was \u0026ldquo;adopted\u0026rdquo; under traditional family law that is no longer valid in Korea to Yi Eun\u0026rsquo;s, that is the former Crown Prince\u0026rsquo;s, line. Yi Eun\u0026rsquo;s son Yi Gu did not have sons, which broke the direct line of the Crown Prince. In order to carry on that line, Yi Won became Yi Gu\u0026rsquo;s adopted son.\nFigure 3: Yoink!\nThe problem under modern Korean family law is that the \u0026ldquo;adoption\u0026rdquo; happened after Yi Gu\u0026rsquo;s death, which makes it legally invalid. Posthumous adoption of a male relative to carry on a broken family line, however, was fairly common in Korea prior to the 20th century. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s no longer legally valid, the Jeonju Yi family as a private association can decide its own rules of succession, and if they decree that Yi Won is Yi Eun\u0026rsquo;s grandson by posthumous adoption, they\u0026rsquo;re free to do that. This would not be valid for the purpose of inheritance and other matters under Korean law, but for deciding who the family decides is its own head? Why not.\nJust be glad it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a monkey. Or Andrew Lee.\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/crown-prince-korea/","summary":"The Korean-American businessman Andrew Lee is not the Crown Prince of Korea.

It was a little bit more of a hassle than I anticipated, given my complete unfamiliarity with systemd, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d document it for my own records and in case it\u0026rsquo;s useful to someone else on a distribution with systemd who has a similar use-case to mine.\nWhy a systemd timer and not cron? In my case, mostly because I already have systemd and the timer comes with it, while I\u0026rsquo;d have to install cron. Evidently a systemd timer also has some advantages over cron such as easy debugging and flexibility. The Arch Wiki lists some benefits and caveats of using the systemd timer as a cron replacement.\nStep 1: Set up the backup script I used rsync for the backup script. While I\u0026rsquo;m not ssh-ing into an external machine and just using an external hard drive, it\u0026rsquo;s simple yet robust enough for this use-case, too. My backup script file is just a shell script that starts with lines like:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 #!/bin/sh # Backup documents rsync -a /home/ljwrites/Documents/ /external/hdd/Documents/ # Backup pictures rsync -a /home/ljwrites/Pictures/ /external/hdd/Pictures/ # Backup config folder rsync -a /home/ljwrites/.config /external/hdd/Programs/ As you may know if you have some familiarity with rsync, the trailing slash on the source is significant. Without the trailing slash, the files in the source directory are copied into a subdirectory of the destination. This means that, in the above example, files and diretories from the Documents and Pictures directories are backed up to the Documents and Pictures directories of the external drive. The files and directories in .config, on the other hand, are backed up to Programs/.config in the external drive.\nThis file was made executable with chmod +x and lives in my ~/.local/bin with the file name backup. Yeah, I guess it should be backup.sh, but without the extension it\u0026rsquo;s shorter to run manually from the command line and it works. I am told the more proper way to do this is by creating a symlink named backup to my actual .sh file, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have a separate coding or development directory and I\u0026rsquo;m lazy lol.\nOh, and of course, to call backup in ~/.local/bin directly from the command line I had to add ~/.local/bin to my $PATH, which I did with a line in .bashrc like this:\n1 PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/go/bin:$PATH I put ~/.local/bin and ~/go/bin ahead of $PATH rather than appending them, btw, because this way my local executables take precedence over the system ones. If there happens to be a binary called backup in the system files, for instance, when I type backup in the terminal I\u0026rsquo;ll be getting the backup script I wrote. This was another piece of advice from my dev friend, one that I actually took.\nOnce the backup script is tested and confirmed to be working, it\u0026rsquo;s time to set up the systemd service and timer.\nStep 2: Set up the systemd service and timer I wrote a filebackup.service text file that consists of just the following lines:\n[Unit] Description=File backup service [Service] ExecStart=/home/ljwrites/.local/bin/backup You can set the description to whatever text string you like, and ExecStart is obviously a call to execute the backup file I put in .local/bin.\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s my filebackup.timer file:\n[Unit] Description=Hourly backup of files [Timer] OnCalendar=Hourly AccuracySec=1s Persistent=false Unit=filebackup.service [Install] WantedBy=timers.target OnCalendar=Hourly sets the hourly interval, and Unit calls the filebackup.service from above. I have no idea if timers.target is the best timer for this but it works. There\u0026rsquo;s a more detailed explanation of timer types on (where else?) Stack Exchange, so check up on that if you\u0026rsquo;re interested. According to that explanation it looks like basic.target would have worked, too.\nI moved both the service and timer files to the /etc/systemd/system directory.\nStep 3: Activate the systemd timer You can check the list of timers with:\nsystemctl list-timers You can include inactive timers with the --all flag:\nsystemctl list-timers --all filebackup.timer shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be on the list yet. You can add it with:\nsudo systemctl enable --now filebackup.timer Check timer list again and it should be there, with the NEXT and LEFT columns set to the start of the next hour.\nUpdate 2021/6/15: If the NEXT and LEFT columns of the backup timer show up as n/a, it may help to restart it using the following command:\nsudo systemctl restart filebackup.timer Step 4: Check if the backup ran with systemd journal You can check if the backup timer is running on schedule with:\nsudo journalctl -u filebackup.* I\u0026rsquo;ve set this to an alias because I like the peace of mind in knowing I have regular backups of my stuff.\n1 alias backupcheck=\u0026#39;sudo journalctl -u filebackup.*\u0026#39; And that\u0026rsquo;s it! There you have it, my file backup setup. It\u0026rsquo;s really simple and basic, but does what I need it to do. It also took me a while to get working properly because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find specific step-by-step instructions for my particular needs. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;ll help others who have similar use-cases but are not devs.\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/backup-systemd-timer/","summary":"How I set up a systemd timer for regular automated backups of selected directories.","title":"My Simple Directory Backup with a systemd Timer"},{"content":"種花\nOn Gardening\n種花愁未發 花發又愁落\n開落摠愁人 未識種花樂\nI plant the seed and fear it may not bloom;\nThe flower blossoms, O but it will fade!\nIn bloom and fade I worry all the same;\nMy heart does but the garden's joys evade.\n\u0026mdash; Yi Gyubo (李奎報), 13th century Korean essayist and poet\nOriginally posted on Mastodon.\n","permalink":"http://ljwrites.blog/posts/on-gardening-poem/","summary":"開落摠愁人 未識種花 In bloom and fade I worry all the same; My heart does but the garden\u0026rsquo;s joys evade.","title":"On Gardening (種花)"}]
