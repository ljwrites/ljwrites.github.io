      <description>A record from the Annals of Sejong of a love disrupted between two enslaved women.</description>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Sossang and Danji were two enslaved maidservants in the Korean royal palace who were in a romantic and sexual relationship with each other, as recorded in the Annals of Sejong the fourth King of Joseon (ruled 1418&ndash;1450).
I discussed this record in a large overview post on <a href="https://ljwrites.blog/posts/queer-premodern-korea/#sossang-and-danji--15th-century--enslaved-women-in-a-known-sexual-relationship">records of homosexuality in premodern Korea</a>.
When I say &ldquo;earlier post&rdquo; or &ldquo;post on premodern homosexuality,&rdquo; that is the post I am referring to.
This post is an expansion of that section with historical and societal background, a translation of relevant passages from the Annals, and my own commentary.</p>
<p>Comments and attention on this incident have mainly focused on a third woman, the Crown Princess Consort from the family Bong, who broke Sossang up with Danji and raped Sossang.
To me, though, the main point of interest in this record is that it depicts a sexual and romantic relationship between enslaved women, one violently disrupted by a jealous princess.
These unique circumstances and the official investigation into them resulted in the only surviving account of named, real-life premodern Korean women in a consensual homosexual relationship, to my knowledge.</p>
<p>Sossang and Danji were far from unique as premodern Korean women who loved each other, of course.
It is indisputable that many such relationships existed, as the record translated here itself demonstrates, along with others discussed in the earlier post.
These relationships existed both in the royal palace where some of these women were caught and punished for their illicit relationships, and also in the wider society where they could not be nearly as effectively surveilled or penalized.
These two particular women simply had the bad luck to be preyed on by a member of the royal family and forced into official attention and the record, in contrast to numerous other women in homosexual relationships who lived and died in what was likely a much safer obscurity.</p>
<p>This makes the record of these two women representative as well as individual:
In addition to discussing the relationship of two specific women, it also talks about them in the larger context of similarly-situated women  loving each other.
It is through a hostile and violent viewpoint, to be sure, but the information we may glean from it is still valuable.</p>
<h2 id="social-and-historical-context">Social and historical context</h2>
<p>The following are notes on the enormous subjects of human enslavement, societal order, and social attitudes toward homosexuality in the relevant era.
I touch on them here to give context to the passages presented in the next section.
If you have no background on premodern Korean society and are interested in learning, you may want to look through this section.
If you would rather dive into the historical material first, feel free to jump to the Translation section and refer back for any confusing details.
I will try again in the Commentary section to synthesize and contextualize the historical record.</p>
<h3 id="slavery-in-the-goryeo-and-joseon-eras">Slavery in the Goryeo and Joseon eras</h3>
<p>You may find it helpful to understand that Sossang and Danji were enslaved domestic servants, and what that meant in the society they lived in.
By slavery I mean the institution of classes of persons who were socially viewed as the &ldquo;property&rdquo; of other persons or institutions, were subject to being bought and sold, and were sharply restricted in their movements, selection of livelihood, ownership of property, and family life.</p>
<p>These enslaved people&rsquo;s status was hereditary, with some Korean societies instituting rules where a person with at least one enslaved parent was also enslaved.
By the post-medieval Joseon era of Korea, the majority of enslaved persons were those who had inherited their status, meaning they were enslaved from birth.
Causes for new supplies of enslaved persons other than heritage included imprisonment in war, unpaid debt, and punishment for serious offenses such as murder or treason including collective punishment of entire family lines and households.</p>
<p>A formal term for enslaved persons was nobi (奴婢), with no (奴) meaning enslaved men and bi (婢) enslaved women.
Another included cheonmin (賤民) or cheonin (賤人) meaning the lowest classes/lowest people, focusing on their social status.
Some cheonmin, such as traveling performers, meat workers in the Joseon era, or shamans were not formally enslaved.
All enslaved classes were cheonmin, however.
A casual term is jong (종), a derogatory word for a servant, many of whom were enslaved persons.</p>
<p>There were broadly two types of nobi in the Goryeo and Joseon (medieval and post-medieval) eras of Korean history, gongnobi (公奴婢) enslaved by public bodies and sanobi (私奴婢) enslaved by private families.
Gongnobi were pressed into service for government and public institutions including central government departments, waystations, palace households, regional prefectures, and Confucian schools.
The large numbers of Buddhist temple-bound nobi during the Goryeo era were transferred to public enslavement and became gongnobi when the temples were reduced in size and possessions.</p>
<p>Sanobi were generally classed into live-in and out-dwelling nobi.
The former were made to live in the households of their enslavers to provide domestic or farm labor, while out-dwelling nobi kept their own households and were compelled to pay their enslavers in products or money.
Out-dwelling nobi, who were the majority of sanobi in the early Joseon era, were similar to free commoners in everyday life and status including the ability to own property and grow their wealth, with the difference that their status could change at the order of their enslavers.
A few such out-dwelling nobi did become famously wealthy, but of course the vast majority of nobi were impoverished from systemic exploitation.</p>
<p>Nobi were subject to enormous social and legal inequities.
Their enslavers had the legal power to punish and control them, so long as the enslavers&rsquo; actions fell short of wilful murder or excessive cruelty.
(Even this minimal restriction was routinely violated, of course.)
Nobi were punished more heavily than free people for any crimes against their enslavers:
The punishment for a nobi battering their enslaver was death by beheading, for instance.
Nobi were also not allowed to report their enslavers&rsquo; crimes unless it was treason.</p>
<p>The control of enslavers over nobi extended into personal and family life as well.
Since nobi status was hereditary and such heritage was the main means for the continuation of the nobi classes, the reproductive and family lives of nobi touched directly on the wealth of their enslavers.
If nobi enslaved by the same entity married each other and had children, it posed no problems for the enslaver and was a welcome addition to their wealth.
However, if two nobi with different enslavers had children, the enslaver of the father was perceived to have suffered a loss because the children would be claimed by their mother&rsquo;s enslaver, to the gain of the mother&rsquo;s enslaver and not the father&rsquo;s.
In such cases, enslaved fathers have been on record as being punished or forced to compensate their enslavers.
The inheritance and sale of enslaved people by their enslavers also disrupted the family lives of the enslaved, as families could be split up in such processes.</p>
<p>The status of children born between free and enslaved persons went back and forth for much of Joseon history in a struggle between the central government and enslaving families.
The government pushed to give these children their freedom so they would owe labor and taxation to the state, while the enslaving classes pushed for children of free-enslaved unions to be enslaved to them so they could continue to extract labor and payment down the generations.
In 1731 the conflict was settled in favor of free status for children of these mixed unions.</p>
<p>The ensuing decades would see the decline of enslavement as an institution as more and more enslaved people had free children, escaped, bought out, or forged papers to free themselves.
The formal institution of slavery was abolished in 1894 along with the class system itself.
The remaining practices of enslavement in private life gradually disappeared with modernization.</p>

<h3 id="dynastic-legitimacy-and-confucian-order-in-joseon">Dynastic legitimacy and Confucian order in Joseon</h3>
<p>Another crucial background of this incident is the vast political change that still reverberated through the kingdom.
The record takes place in in CE 1436, Year 18 of Sejong the fourth king of Joseon, only 44 years after the kingdom was founded in 1392.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Sejong&rsquo;s grandfather Yi Seong-gye was a late Goryeo-era general and politician who seized power in the tumult from the fall of the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China, chaos in Goryeo from geopolitical turmoil and internal conflicts, and mounting challenges to governance including the inadequacy of state revenue and failing central control.
The section of the earlier premodern homosexuality post on <a href="https://ljwrites.blog/posts/queer-premodern-korea/#king-gongmin-of-goryeo--14th-century--no-woman-but-his-wife-crossdressing-male-lovers">King Gongmin</a> discusses his failed attempts to reform and stabilize the troubled kingdom.
After dethroning and executing Gongmin&rsquo;s three successors, Yi Seong-gye finally took the throne for himself and founded the new kingdom of Joseon.
He would be known as Taejo the founding king of Joseon.</p>
<p>Having wrested power from the Goryeo dynasty, Yi Seong-gye/Taejo and his line had to prove that they were not mere usurpers but worthy of ruling as kings.
The new dynasty sought to establish such legitimacy in part by instilling a strict Confucian order, placing the King at the apex of secular order and fathers at the tops of their own households.
The new Yi royal family could pose themselves as the enforcers of stability and order after the turmoil of the Goryeo years, and as upholders of patriarchal rule and morality in contrast to the libertine excesses of Goryeo.
This direction also aligned the royal family with the Confucian bureaucrat class who were a major source of support during the late Goryeo years and beyond.</p>
<p>Confucianism was not only a political ideology but a program of social control over private and political life alike.</p>
<p>In this ideal, when applied to families, children owed filial piety and obedience to patriarchs at the heads of families, and women played roles within their households as obedient wives, daughters, and mothers.
The degree and forms of such control differed greatly across social class, wealth, region, and many other factors, but the ideal existed of an order ruled by benevolent patriarchs at every level of society with all others giving their obedience and support.
This entailed strict controls on women in particular, with expectations of modesty and chastity, obedience to patriarchal social order including submitting to polygamy without jealousy (while wives&rsquo; own sexuality was heavily restricted), and personal virtues of work ethic and gentle temperament essential to the maintenance and reproduction of this social order.</p>
<p>This neo-Confucian order is the context for understanding major points of the  record in the next section, including Sejong as both king and patriarch making decisions about his son the Crown Prince&rsquo;s marriage with little visible input from the Crown Prince himself, and the expectations that were placed on princesses and domestic servants alike for decorum and chastity.
The issues involved more than personal distaste or even marital unfaithfulness, but implicated the stability of the royal family and the kingdom itself in the political-familial-cosmic order they took place in.</p>

<h3 id="homosexuality-in-goryeo-and-joseon">Homosexuality in Goryeo and Joseon</h3>
<p>This incident also seems to reflect changing attitudes toward homosexuality in a time of social transition between the Goryeo and Joseon eras.
One indication of Goryeo-era attitudes is that at least three kings from early and late Goryeo are on record as having been in sexual relationships with men.
The records attach no moral judgment to these relationships so long as they were conducted properly, for instance so long as the king kept up his duty to uphold dynastic continuity.</p>
<p>Two kings of Goryeo were recorded as having homosexual relationships without being morally condemned for it:
King Mokjong in the 10th century had no children with his women consorts (a Queen Consort and a concubine) and had at least one male lover, but it seems this was largely unproblematic because he adopted his young cousin to be his heir.
King Chungseon in the 13th century had Korean and Mongol consorts and concubines he had many children with, and at least one male lover.
He was not morally  judged either for what we would today call a bisexual personal life.</p>
<p>In contrast, Chungseon&rsquo;s grandson King Gongmin in the 14th century was heavily condemned for sexual activities with his male bodyguards because he was apparently a recipient of penetration and caused the young men to do “wanton deeds unto him as to a woman.”
He also had a different male lover for whom the records used the conventional refined and non-judgmental language for such relationships.
The partner himself was criticized for his abuses of power, but this was a common charge across premodern Korean and Chinese records for kings&rsquo; male lovers and female consorts alike.</p>
<p>Failure to carry on the dynasty was another major reason a king who had homosexual relations might face disapproval.
Gongmin&rsquo;s sexuality may be ambiguous in modern terms as he is famous for his emotional attachment to his queen who died having his child, but the historical record also states that sexual intimacy with even her was infrequent and nearly nonexistent with other women.
The <em>History of Goryeo</em> blames this proclivity for Gongmin&rsquo;s lack of an heir and the subsequent uncertainty surrounding his successors&rsquo; legitimacy.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In summary, what mattered in judging the homosexual relationships of Goryeo kings was not  the gender of a king&rsquo;s sexual partner but rather the way the king conducted himself.
For instance, was the sexual activity proper for a king&rsquo;s status?
And did he uphold his duties, especially the paramount one of ensuring the dynasty continued through his heirs?</p>
<p>There are other indications of generally positive or neutral stances toward homosexuality in the Goryeo era.
A case in point is a poem by the famous writer Yi Gyubo about his friend the Buddhist monk Gonggong&rsquo;s <a href="https://ljwrites.blog/posts/queer-premodern-korea/#gonggong-the-enlightened--13th-century--the-monk-unmoved-by-feminine-temptations-falls-for-a-lovely-youth">romantic relationship with a young man</a>.
I am not aware of any Goryeo-era or earlier Korean records, or even literary works about or allusions to female homosexual relationships.
However, as noted in the <a href="https://ljwrites.blog/posts/queer-premodern-korea/#premodern-korean-terminology-on-homosexuality">terminology</a> section of the earlier post, the origin of the widely-used term daeshik was in female homosexuality and knowledge of the practice was widespread.
Yi Gyubo&rsquo;s poem uses the term to celebrate love between men.</p>
<p>Joseon&rsquo;s official royal records depart from the generally accepting attitude toward homosexuality in Goryeo-era records.
The Annals of the kings of Joseon are to the best of my knowledge entirely devoid of any direct record of homosexual activity by kings, and the rape of Sossang by the Crown Princess Consort Bong appears to be the only record of homosexual activity by a member of the royal family, taking place in the very early years of dynastic history at that.</p>
<p>One explanation for this change is that the Yi dynasty really was made of entirely different stuff from the preceding Wang dynasty and were an entirely heterosexual family line that never had any homosexual or gender non-conforming leanings for half a millennium.
The other is that, as part of the dynasty&rsquo;s self-image as enforcers and upholders of patriarchal family order, such records were increasingly suppressed where the royal family was concerned.
Having no solid factual basis for either conclusion, I will leave the matter up for readers to decide.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, records of homosexuality persist throughout the Joseon period in other sectors of Korean society.
Unambiguous references to homosexual activity by high-ranking lords and ladies are last seen in the 15th century, but strongly suggestive to unambiguous accounts of both female and male homosexuality among working and monastic classes appear into the 19th century.
For more details, refer to the latter parts of the earlier premodern homosexuality post.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that homosexuality was not singled out for particular condemnation compared to what was viewed as illicit heterosexual activity.
As also noted in the earlier post, illicit heterosexual activity by palace attendants could carry even heavier penalties than homosexual ones, and there is no evidence of official penalties for homosexual activities outside the context of the palace as opposed to, say, male-female adultery.
The national project, as discussed in the earlier section on Confucian order, was to uphold patriarchal familial and political order, and both heterosexual and homosexual activities could be a threat.
In general moral rules and criminal law had much more to say about illicit heterosexual activities than homosexual ones, and other than general disapproval and penalties under some very specific circumstances (such as palace life, adultery, and false accusations), there is no evidence of official organized crackdowns on homosexuality in of itself.</p>
<h2 id="translation-of-excerpts-from-the-record">Translation of excerpts from the record</h2>
<p>[Translator&rsquo;s notes and summaries in square brackets.]</p>
<p>Book 75 of the Annals of Sejong; second article of the 26th day of Month 10, Sejong Year 1, Year of Yellow Rat &lt;CE 1436, Ming zhèngtǒng 正统 Year 1&gt;</p>
<p>上御思政殿, 召都承旨辛引孫、同副承旨權採, 令就御榻前, 屛左右曰:</p>
<p>The King went out to Sajeong-jeon [the hall where state matters were discussed] where he summoned Doseungji [official of the department that sent out royal decrees] Shin Inson and Dongbuseungji [a lower official of the same department] Gwon Chae to call them before the royal seat, then sent out the other officials and said:</p>
<p>比年以來, 事多不諧, 心實無聊, 近又有一異事, 言之亦可羞恥。</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since this year I have no peace because so many matters have gone amiss.
Another matter has arisen lately that is shameful even to speak of.</p>
<p>我祖宗以來, 家法克正, 比及予身, 亦賴中宮之助。</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order in the home has been set to utmost uprightness ever since the advent of this dynasty and court, and in matters of my own person I have been greatly aided by my Queen Consort.</p>
<p>中宮極柔嘉, 無妬忌之意, 太宗每稱有樛木逮下之德, 以故家道雍穆, 以至于今。</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Queen Consort is exceedingly gentle in character and all her words and deeds are exemplary without a shadow of possessive jealousy.
King Taejong [Sejong&rsquo;s father, the third King of Joseon] regularly heaped praise on her virtue as being like the supple branches of a tree reaching downward.
Thus was the state of affairs until the present time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Here follows an account of Sejong&rsquo;s son the Crown Prince&rsquo;s marital history.
The Crown Prince, who would go on to become the next king Munjong, was first married at the age of 14 to beget heirs early, but the first Crown Princess Consort from House Kim lost her position for a scandal involving the use of magical curses out of jealousy.
Her successor as Crown Princess Consort was a young lady from House Bong, but her marital relationship with the Crown Prince was also lacking and they had no children.
Sejong and his Queen Consort did their best to teach their daughter-in-law in the ways of the home and a royal wife, but &ldquo;as even parents may not fully instruct their children in matters of the bedroom,&rdquo; the situation improved little except in appearance.
Three royal concubines were therefore selected from good families for the Crown Prince, which angered his Princess Consort who was of a jealous temperament.
She was especially threatened and even wept out loud when one of her husband&rsquo;s concubines, a lady from House Gwon, fell pregnant.
Her parents-in-law the King and Queen remonstrated the Crown Princess Consort against such unseemly jealousy in a wife and Princess Consort, to no avail.]</p>
<p>[Then there follows an account of Crown Princess Consort Bong&rsquo;s other improprieties, including allowing an elderly servant woman to make her parents garments out of the Crown Prince&rsquo;s undergarments; falsely claiming to be pregnant and then to have miscarried; watching outsiders through cracks in the attendants&rsquo; outhouse walls; having her maidservants sing songs about loving men; personally making items such as knee protectors and pouches for palace eunuchs, leaving her no time to make items for the Crown Prince&rsquo;s birthday and giving him old birthday offerings as though they were new; sending excess items and food to her mother&rsquo;s house without telling the Crown Prince; and giving gifts in thanks for her father&rsquo;s funerary rites, also without telling the Crown Prince.]</p>
<p>若此不穩之事頗多, 予皆以婦人不識大體, 故置之。</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were many such improprieties that I let pass, thinking that she simply did not know the great courtesies of a wife.</p>
<p>近聞奉氏愛一宮婢召雙者, 常不離左右, 宮人或相言: &ldquo;嬪與召雙常同寢處。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recently I have heard that Lady Bong loved Sossang, a bi [enslaved woman] of the palace and would not let her leave her side, and the palace attendants would whisper to each other, &lsquo;The Princess Consort always beds and abides with Sossang.&rsquo;</p>
<p>一日, 召雙灑掃宮內, 世子忽問: &ldquo;汝信與嬪同寢乎?&rdquo; 召雙愕然對曰: &ldquo;然。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day Sossang was cleaning in the palace when the Crown Prince suddenly asked her, &lsquo;Is it true you sleep with the Princess Consort?&rsquo; To which Sossang replied in her fright: &lsquo;It is, Your Grace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>其後頗聞奉氏酷愛召雙, 暫離左右, 則恨恚曰: &ldquo;我雖甚愛汝, 汝則不甚愛我。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterward it was heard many a time that Lady Bong in her love for Sossang would be resentful and angry if the girl left her side for a moment, and would say, &lsquo;I love you to distraction, yet you love me but little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>召雙亦常謂人曰: &ldquo;嬪之愛我, 頗異於常, 我甚惶恐。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sossang herself would always be telling those around her, &lsquo;The Crown Princess Consort&rsquo;s love for me is quite out of the ordinary and it frightens me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>召雙又與權承徽私婢端之相好, 或與同寢, 奉氏以私婢石加伊, 常隨其後, 使不得與端之同遊。</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sossang was also intimate with Royal Concubine Gwon&rsquo;s [the Crown Prince&rsquo;s concubine&rsquo;s] sabi [privately enslaved woman] Danji and the two would sleep together.
Lady Bong would have her sabi Seokga&rsquo;i always shadow Sossang, frustrating her attempts to spend time with Danji.</p>
<p>先是, 奉氏晨興, 常使侍婢斂衾枕, 自與召雙寢處以後, 不復使侍婢而自斂之, 又潛使其婢澣濯其衾。</p>
<p>&ldquo;Previously Lady Bong would have her attending maidservant [I will use this term from here on for enslaved women in this particular context of domestic servitude] take away her pillows and bedding at dawn when she rose, but since sleeping and sharing her bedding with Sossang she never again gave the task to her attending maidservant but would gather the items herself, and have her maidservant wash the bedding in secret.</p>
<p>此事頗喧於宮中, 故予與中宮召召雙而問其狀, 召雙言: &ldquo;去歲冬至, 嬪夜召我入內, 他婢皆在戶外, 要我同宿, 我辭之, 嬪强之, 不得已半脫衣入屛裏, 嬪盡奪餘衣, 强使入臥相戲, 有如男子交合狀。&rdquo;</p>
<p>[CAUTION: THIS PARAGRAPH IS A VICTIM&rsquo;S FIRST-HAND ACCOUNT OF RAPE BY COERCION]</p>
<p>&ldquo;With these matters causing a stir in the palace, the Queen Consort and I summoned Sossang to ask her the truth of it.
She said: &lsquo;This past winter solstice the Princess Consort called me inside while all the other maidservants waited outside the door.
She demanded I sleep with her, which I demurred.
She forced the matter, however, and unable to say no, I took off half my clothes to enter behind the screen.
The Princess Consort took away the rest of my clothes, made me enter and lie down, and we pleasured each other in form similar to lying with a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>予常聞侍女從婢等私相交好, 與同寢處, 甚惡之, 宮中嚴立禁令, 有犯者, 司察之女卽啓, 決杖七十, 猶不能禁止, 則或加杖一百, 然後其風稍息。</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often did I hear that female attendants, maidservants and others would engage in such private unsanctioned intimacy, sleeping and abiding with each other.
Loathing such custom I set up strict prohibitions in the palace, and those found in violation by the report of the watching women were put to seventy strikes; if this was insufficient to deter them they would be put to 100 more, after which the custom somewhat abated.</p>
<p>予之惡有此風, 殆天誘其衷而然也。豈圖世子之嬪, 亦慕此風, 蕩泆如此?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely my hatred of this custom was Heaven moving my heart.
How could I have ever thought that the Crown Prince&rsquo;s own Consort would follow such custom to this wantonness?</p>
<p>乃召嬪而問之, 答曰: &ldquo;召雙與端之, 常時愛好, 不獨夜同寢宿, 晝亦交頸砥舌, 此乃彼之所爲, 我則初無同宿之事。&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I summoned the Princess Consort to ask her about this matter, to which she answered:
&lsquo;Sossang and Danji were constant in their loving intimacy and would not only lie together at night, but also embrace neck-to-neck and suck on each others&rsquo; tongues in the day.
These were things they did together, that is all, and from the first there was never a time when I lay together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>然諸證甚明, 豈能終諱? 且彼人交頸砥舌之事, 亦豈嬪之所宜知乎? 常見其事而歆羨, 則其勢必效而爲之, 益無疑矣。</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet with the evidence so clear, how could the truth be hidden to the end?
And how could the Princess Consort have known that those two sucked tongue neck-to-neck?
Doubtless that in always watching and envying such conduct, the weight of events would balance toward emulation and action.</p>
<p>其餘使侍婢唱歌及窺壁隙等事, 悉皆自服, 然餘事皆輕, 若非召雙之事, 則雖置之可也, 及聞召雙之事, 然後予意斷然欲廢。</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other matters, such as causing maidservants to sing and looking out through wall cracks, she has confessed to in their entirety.
The others are all relatively minor in nature, and if it were not for the matter of Sossang I could leave things be.
However, having heard about the matter of Sossang, I am resolved to remove [the Princess Consort] from her position.</p>
<p>夫冢婦之職, 所係匪輕, 有此失德, 其何以承宗祀而母儀於一國乎?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The office of the eldest legitimate son&rsquo;s wife is no light thing.
With her having thus lapsed in her virtue, how could she uphold the house and set an example as the mother of the nation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Sejong then goes into the intricacies of the situation and the gravity of removing a Princess Consort to raise another, especially when he had already removed one Crown Princess Consort.
He discusses precedent from Chinese antiquity both for and against the decision, and how a second removal of a Crown Princess Consort would shock and unsettle the country.
He consulted on the matter with high officials who were unanimous that Crown Princess Consort Bong must be expelled.]</p>
<p>斷以大義, 不得不然, 卿等詳知首末, 作敎旨草以進。 昔金氏之廢, 予方年少氣銳, 謂廢立重事, 不可曖昧, 故詳載其事於敎書, 今則不必然也。</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the greater good I assuredly cannot do otherwise.
You, sirs, are apprised of the matter from its very beginning; you will draft the decree and submit it.
Back when I removed Lady Kim [the former Crown Princess Consort before Lady Bong] I was young in age and sharp of temperament, and had the matter accounted in detail in the decree because I deemed removing [a Princess Consort] and raising [another] to be a manner of great gravity where nothing may rightly be left ambiguous.
That will not be necessary, however, in the present case.</p>

<h2 id="commentary">Commentary</h2>
<p>This incident appears to have been a perfect storm of the pressures and mores of the age.
Sejong betrays his, and his house&rsquo;s, self-consciousness as the king of a still-new dynasty (&ldquo;ever since the advent of this dynasty and court&hellip;&rdquo;), and is eager to make his own house an exemplar of domestic propriety and harmony, something he credits in part to the assistance of his virtuous chief consort the Queen.
The ideological and political need to establish the still-new dynasty as the chief protector of family virtue and order resulted in a zeal to clean house, especially by controlling the conduct of women as a centerpiece of patriarchal order.</p>
<p>Leadership by example from the virtuous wife of the patriarch was particularly important to establish such familial order.
To this end, the impeccable conduct of Sejong&rsquo;s Queen Consort is contrasted to Crown Princess Consort Bong&rsquo;s wanton and improper ways, with the Queen held up as the ideal the Crown Princess Consort must live up to as the future Queen Consort herself.</p>
<p>It is telling that Crown Princess Consort Bong was her husband&rsquo;s second Crown Princess Consort to be expelled from court, and the third for the new dynasty.
As discussed by Sejong, there was a Crown Princess Consort Kim before her who was removed for jealousy and the use of magic, which were violations of wifely virtues such as acceptance of a husband&rsquo;s other partners and spiritual purity dictated by Confucianism.
Going back two reigns to Sejong&rsquo;s grandfather Taejo the first King of Joseon, and only in the second year of his reign and of the dynasty in fact, Taejo&rsquo;s daughter-in-law the Crown Princess Consort Yu was also removed from her position and sent back home.
Though Taejo refused to share the reason for the expulsion with his officials much to their consternation,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> the beheading of a eunuch named Kim Manri at the same time led to the speculation that some improper conduct had taken place.</p>
<p>These expulsion incidents so early in the dynasty seem to be a sign of a clash between old and new norms.
It seems unlikely that three different young women of very prominent families chosen by an intensive selection process were wholly unaware and unprepared for the demands of being a Princess Consort, and it is more plausible that they fell afoul of new norms that they did not expect.
The records of the previous Goryeo dynasty are rife with accounts of royal women taking lovers and having children out of wedlock.
It may be that highborn women used to greater sexual and personal freedoms failed to meet more restrictive social norms that had not entirely settled in yet in the first decades of the Joseon dynasty.</p>
<p>Greater control and repression took effect for women at the bottom of the palace hierarchy as well as those at the top.
Sejong&rsquo;s account of love among female palace attendants and maidservants (enslaved female domestic servants) is an incontrovertible record of women workers loving other women.
His fervency in violently attempting stamp out what he found a loathsome custom was another aspect of his efforts to mold his household, the highest in the land, into the exemplary Confucian ideal of feminine modesty and propriety.</p>
<p>As live-in domestic servants, Sossang and Danji also led some of the most restricted and closely-watched lives among enslaved classes of people.
The record shows that Sossang was enslaved by a public institution while Danji was a privately enslaved live-in domestic worker who was in the palace as part of a royal concubine&rsquo;s household.
In practice they would both have been live-in enslaved persons pressed into domestic servitude, since palace households doubled as both public institutions and family homes.
This meant they had no households of their own and were continuously on duty.
Even aside from the control their enslavers had over their family and reproduction as enslaved women, simply forming unions and having children in the first place may have been unacceptable given the exploitative labor demands placed on them.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, working-class women in the palace loving other women would have been a plausible avenue of sexuality and intimacy for those inclined to engage in it.
The Goryeo dynasty&rsquo;s institution of slavery and labor exploitation was at least as rapacious as Joseon&rsquo;s, but the comparatively lenient attitudes toward homosexuality and women&rsquo;s sexuality may have provided some cover.
These private intimacies may have developed into a custom that the next dynasty would come to decry and try to suppress with violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try&rdquo; is the operative word, of course, when it comes to suppressing women&rsquo;s love.
As discussed in the earlier homosexuality post, records and contemporary commentary state or strongly suggest that the more elite ranks of female palace attendants persisted in sexual relationships with women as well as men.
While the sex lives of enslaved women workers in the palace fade from the later official records, it seems likely that homosexual affairs continued to feature in some of their lives as well.
It is impossible to tell whether sexual affairs between enslaved women workers in the palace even abated in Sejong&rsquo;s own time or were simply hidden better, despite the credit he gave himself for phasing out this custom with violent crackdowns.</p>
<p>These efforts to suppress women&rsquo;s homosexuality were limited in scope as well as effectiveness.
This is without discounting how violent, repressive, and destructive these penalties were to the women who were caught up in them, of course.
Sejong himself only spoke of setting up strict prohibitions <em>in the palace,</em> not the entirety of Joseon where there is no evidence of a general ban on male or female homosexuality though plenty of societal disapproval.</p>
<p>The official criminal codes of the time are silent on consensual homosexuality, though there is no doubt that the general and increasing restrictions placed on women&rsquo;s lives and sexuality would have sharply limited their sexual activities with women as well as with men.
It is likely that there were also many incidents of private violence and discrimination that were never committed to the written record.
In the case of rape, there were codes that punished the rape of a man by a man, but not of a woman by a woman such as Crown Princess Consort Bong was described as perpetuating on Sossang.</p>
<p>Criminal codes against rape would not have protected Sossang in any case.
As an enslaved woman she was not legally protected from her enslavers&rsquo; violence against her whatever their gender, and she would not have been able to report them through official channels.
Nor would a nobleman, far less a male member of the royal household, have faced any consequences for assaulting her.
Princess Consort Bong was removed from her position not for rape but for having an adulterous affair, much as Princess Consort Yu apparently was four decades earlier for her affair with a eunuch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as previously discussed, homosexuality was a form of improper sex but not the only form.
Though homosexual activities by women was officially repressed in certain limited contexts, they were not singled out for homosexuality in of itself but rather for the crime of illicit sex, whether with men or with women.
Depending on the time period, a palace attendant having sex with a man other than the king was punishable by beheading for both parties, in contrast to the 70 blows on a first offense as mentioned by Sejong for homosexual activity.
Kim Manri, the eunuch who appears to have been accused of adultery with Crown Princess Consort Yu in the first expulsion of a Princess Consort of Joseon, was similarly beheaded.</p>
<p>The record makes no mention of Sossang&rsquo;s and her lover Danji&rsquo;s fates, but we can speculate.
It seems unlikely that they were given an official death sentence, especially since there were so many indications that Sossang was not a willing participant in the Princess&rsquo;s adultery.
They could still have been punished for their relationship with each other, however, and may have been run out to fend for themselves or transferred to far harsher conditions.
Even more grimly, it would not have been difficult to permanently silence two extremely vulnerable and marginalized women for the sake of preventing further embarrassment to the royal family.</p>
<p>A final point is the clarification that there was certainly homophobia in Joseon, and the specifics of criminal codes do nothing to take away from bigotry.
It is itself sexist and homophobic, after all, to view homosexuality especially between women, and rape of a woman by a woman, as &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; activities that do not &ldquo;count.&rdquo;
There are also passages from scholarly texts in the late Joseon era showing clear disdain and disapproval of male homosexuality and possibly of female homosexuality, as <a href="https://ljwrites.blog/posts/queer-premodern-korea/#ruffians-and-monks--18th-19th-centuries--practitioners-of-male-homosexuality">discussed in the earlier post</a>.
The contention is not that there was no homophobia in Joseon, but rather that homosexuality was considered no more of a threat to the prevailing neo-Confucian order than illicit forms of heterosexuality.
As with the social forms of homosexuality itself, the specifics of homophobia also differ by society and context.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We know about Sossang and Danji because their lives were turned upside-down by events outside their control.
Their relationship was recorded under their true names and known to this day only because a princess stalked and raped Sossang, and the state bureaucracy headed by the princess&rsquo;s father-in-law deemed this a matter worthy of investigation&mdash;not as rape, but as sexual indiscretion unbecoming of a wife&rsquo;s virtue.
Sejong&rsquo;s comments provide a window into the broader custom of working women in the palace, attendants and enslaved domestic servants, entering into romantic and sexual relationships with each other.</p>
<p>A part of Sossang and Danji&rsquo;s story still comes through with moving truth and immediacy even through this hostile lens of interpersonal and institutional violence:
These two enslaved women shared a relationship that aroused the envy of a princess who felt entitled to strip away the comfort shared by women in servitude who had so little else.
At the same time, the broader community of working women who loved women aroused the king&rsquo;s moralistic ire in a violent backlash.</p>
<p>Sejong&rsquo;s attempts to eradicate women&rsquo;s love in the palace were a failure, however.
Later records and commentary attest that this custom he so hated persisted in the very heart of Joseon&rsquo;s moralistic patriarchal order, the palace where his ancestral spirit was enshrined after his death.
The king claimed Heaven had moved his heart to loathe the custom of women loving women.
Perhaps these women were moved by a less lofty and more abiding power to be so constant in their loving intimacy with each other.</p>

<p>This was also seven years before the promulgation of Hangul in 1443, for those who remember what Sejong is most famous for.

<p>Taejo&rsquo;s expulsion of Crown Princess Consort Yu without any explanation was a cause of political strife and purges, and multiple officials were exiled for speaking out. Perhaps Sejong wanted to avoid similar political fallout when he shared details with the country in Princess Consort Kim&rsquo;s case and at least with his closest officials in Princess Consort Bong&rsquo;s. It may also be a sign of a more mature bureaucratic and political system, with an assertive bureaucratic class demanding transparency and a king who had been trained from a young age as a royal prince, unlike  his grandfather Taejo who was a soldier born in Mongol-controlled borderlands.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <title>Records of homosexuality in premodern Korea</title>

      <description>Who could their emulation of / the courtly love infringe?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is a compilation and summary of accounts from premodern Korea, defined here as largely pre-20th century, recording homosexual, gender-ambiguous/non-conforming, and otherwise queer experiences.
It will begin with a summation of premodern Korean terms on homosexuality, then discuss specific accounts of homosexuality, bisexuality, and gender nonconformity that we might today read as queer or LGBTQA, including the context of times and life history where available.
Classist bias is heavy in the historical record and many of the detailed personal contexts tend to be available for members of the ruling class such as kings, but contexts for other individual personages or classes of persons can be gleaned through the terminology used, descriptions of social customs, and the rare instances where same-gender love between working-class people, primarily of women, touched on the perceived dignity and rights of men in the ruling classes.</p>
<p>I am greatly indebted in the preparation of this write-up to Professor Kang Moon-jong&rsquo;s <em>Studies on the traditional era homosexuality</em>, published in the journal Yeongju Eomun Vol. 30 (June 2015), especially for alerting me to the existence of Yi Gyubo&rsquo;s <em>Poem Prompted by the 50 Verses Sent by Enlightened Gongong to young Master Bak</em> and some of the events and writings from the Joseon era.
The section on terminology also follows both the format of his paper and draws directly from his summation of the terms, with some modifications and additions.
Where I was unable to independently confirm a primary or secondary source cited by Professor Kang but rather rely on the paper itself, I have cited it as &ldquo;Kang (2015)&rdquo; or &ldquo;via Kang (2015).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Content warnings for this write-up include sexual violence, age gap/possible underage relationships, corporeal punishment and other violence against queer people, general political violence including murder, death from coerced labor, cisnormativity, sexism/patriarchy, etc.</p>
<h2 id="premodern-korean-terminology-on-homosexuality">Premodern Korean terminology on homosexuality</h2>
<p>The most common word for homosexuality in premodern Korea was daeshik 對食 (&ldquo;eat together&rdquo;).
Originating from the Han Dynasty of China, this referred to palace servants including maids and eunuchs entering into marriage-like committed relationships with each other.
In premodern Korea the word came to mean homosexuality in general between men and women alike, though its original meaning of love in the specific setting of court was also preserved.
A related though rarer and more limited term is gyobung 交朋 (&ldquo;making friends&rdquo;), a term that is listed to this day in the dictionary as a traditional term for female homosexuality, though it has faded from everyday use.</p>
<p>Other common terms included namchong 男寵 (&ldquo;favor of men&rdquo;) and the related one of namsaek 男色 (&ldquo;sex with men&rdquo;), which referred exclusively to male homosexuality.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Yongyang 龍陽 (&ldquo;dragon sunlight&rdquo;) was a related term referring to the title given to a king&rsquo;s favored male lover from the ancient Wei Dynasty of China, and can be seen especially in the History of Goryeo regarding favors given by kings to male lovers.</p>
<p>There are also terms relating to rape of men by men, gyegan 鷄姦 (&ldquo;chicken fornication?&rdquo;), also of Chinese origin.
Other terms relating to this crime that has seen some use in premodern Korea are bukchung 北衝 (&ldquo;northern/hind stabbing&rdquo;) and namgan 男奸 (&ldquo;male fornication&rdquo;) which seem to refer primarily to anal rape.</p>
<p>There are also the Korean terms biyeokjil 비역질 for sex between men and baendaejil 밴대질 for sex between women, but the latter is of uncertain origin and there is no existing premodern record using the term.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the leading terms for homosexuality in premodern Korean societies include daeshik (women and men), namchong (men), namsaek (men), biyeokjil (men), and in some specific circumstances, yongyang for men in court.
These terms show widespread awareness of homosexual activity in premodern Korea, with differentiation for specific social contexts.</p>

<h2 id="king-hyegong-of-shilla--8th-century--a-woman-born-in-a-man-s-body">King Hyegong of Shilla (8th century): A woman born in a man&rsquo;s body</h2>
<p>The reign of King Hyegong, the 36th king of the ancient Korean kingdom of Shilla, was marked by strife and chaos ever since taking the throne at the age of eight, with power struggles and rebellions compounded by catastrophic natural disasters.
The king was eventually slain in the political turmoil, and the end of this monarch&rsquo;s reign marks the close of the Middle Period of Shilla and the start of its Final Period.</p>
<p>It is said that King Gyeongdeok, Hyegong&rsquo;s father, badly wanted a son, having set aside his first queen for the lack of a son and wedded a second queen.
The story goes that King Gyeongdeok asked a spiritual man, Pyohun, to petition the Jade Emperor in Heaven for a royal son.
Pyohun, after meeting with the Jade Emperor, gave word from on high that there was a daughter for the king but no son.
King Gyeongdeok, persistent in his goal, asked that the daughter be exchanged for a son.
The Jade Emperor warned that it was possible, but the change would endanger the kingdom.
Gyeongdeok was unwavering, and indeed his wife gave birth to a male-assigned baby.</p>
<p>It was said that the future King Hyegong&rsquo;s unnatural birth that switched a girl into a boy caused disturbing portents, with intense thunder and lightning storms and 16 Buddhist temples being struck by lightning.
The young prince enjoyed girls&rsquo; amusements and adornments from a young age, causing people to comment on the child&rsquo;s lack of fitness as a future king.
Some say the allegations of the prince&rsquo;s birth and femininity are a commentary on King Hyegong&rsquo;s ineffectual reign.</p>
<p>King Hyegong, along with regent and mother Queen Dowager Manwol, made many attempts from early in the young king&rsquo;s reign to reinforce the failing power of the monarchy, including reforms to ancestral rites and inspecting the regions.
However, it was not enough to turn the tides of the increasing disorder from the father King Gyeongdeok&rsquo;s time.
Hyegong was said to be a soft and undisciplined king who was enamored of music and women, and was ultimately slain by high-ranking nobility at the age of 22.</p>

<h2 id="king-mokjong-of-goryeo--10th-century--the-childless-king-with-a-known-male-lover">King Mokjong of Goryeo (10th century): The childless king with a known male lover</h2>
<p>The seventh king of the medieval Korean kingdom of Goryeo and son of Gyeongjong the fifth king, Mokjong was known for his talent from a young age and for wise and beneficient policies a king, such as diplomatic efforts that promoted peace and establishment of bureaucratic and military systems for the still-new kingdom.
His reign, however, was marred by his failure to control the arbitrary abuses of power by his mother Queen Dowager Heonae.
In the end the confusion caused by the Queen Dowager&rsquo;s attempts to take power with her lover Kim Chi-yang led to a rebellion, and Mokjong was assassinated at the age of 28.</p>
<p>Mokjong had a queen and a concubine but was known to be uninterested in women and had no children, something that he expressed concern for.
He named his nephew (the son of his mother&rsquo;s late sister) First Prince Daeryang as his heir, and Prince Daeryang went on to be King Hyeonjong after him.</p>
<p>Mokjong had a lover, Yu Haeng-gan, a beautiful man who gained the king&rsquo;s favor and rose to high office on that basis in a relationship referred to as yongyang.
Yu Haeng-gan was said to be a power-hungry and arrogant man of little ability or wisdom who leaned on the king&rsquo;s favor to exercise power and prestige beyond his station and talents.
Yu Haeng-gan was opposed to Mokjong making Prince Daeryang the royal heir, so much that Mokjong made the preparations a secret from his lover.
There is speculation that Yu Chungjeong, another man that Yu Haeng-gan introduced to the king, was also a royal lover, but unlike with Yu Haeng-gan there is no direct record of a sexual relationship between Mokjong and Yu Chungjeong.
Yu Haeng-gan was also killed during the rebellion that ended Mokjong&rsquo;s reign, while there is no record of Yu Chungjeong&rsquo;s death though he was recorded as being by Mokjong&rsquo;s side when the king was expelled from the palace prior to his death.</p>

<h2 id="gonggong-the-enlightened--13th-century--the-monk-unmoved-by-feminine-temptations-falls-for-a-lovely-youth">Gonggong the Enlightened (13th century): The monk unmoved by feminine temptations falls for a lovely youth</h2>
<p>Gonggong 空空 was the name taken by Great Yuga Master Gyeongjo, who was a monk in the Yuga tradition of Buddhism (originating from an order of monks who cultivated yoga practice) and rose to the rank of Threefold Great Master.
A free spirit who loved the companionship of boys, he was also known as the Poet Monk for his aptitude with verse and the King of Dharma for his deep knowledge of Buddhist doctrine.
His fame reached as far as Song in China, and he was gifted a staff, lacquered begging bowls, and prayer beads along with a poem by an esteemed monk.
He was friends with fellow literary talents of his day, and some of his religious poetry survives today.</p>
<p>The story of the love between Gonggong and a bright young man with the surname Bak is told in verse by Gonggong&rsquo;s friend Yi Gyubo, a celebrated poet and essayist in 12th and 13th century Korea.
Yi Gyubo wrote the poem, 次韻空空上人贈朴少年五十韻 (Poem Prompted by the 50 Verses Sent by Enlightened Gongong to young Master Bak), in response to verse written by Gonggong for his young lover.
The original that Yi was responding to did not survive, but this reply poem is clear enough on the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p>After an opening that discusses the yin and yang principles of the universe and the crucial role of marriage and romantic love, Yi discusses his friend Gonggong&rsquo;s indifference to women:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>孰有相逢花態度<br />
Regardless what the sweetness met<br />
in bloom of womanhood<br />
終然得固鐵肝腸<br />
His heart shall be as hardest steel<br />
unto the bitter end.<br /></p>
</div>
<p>Instead, Yi says, Gonggong chose a simple life in spiritual retreat:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>岩扉寂寞真堪樂<br />
Though little gate is silent, this<br />
austere retreat is joy<br />
世路繁華豈所望<br />
Why at the bustle of the world<br />
wouldst spare a single glance?<br /></p>
</div>
<p>Yet one man, the young Master Bak, captures the great spiritual master&rsquo;s heart:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>未知朴子形何似<br />
I know not how this Master Bak<br />
is shaped or how he looks<br />
坐使空師意反狂<br />
To drive the meditating Gong<br />
to madness in restraint<br /></p>
</div>
<p>Yi vividly describes the feelings induced by this young man in his esteemed friend:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>自說純陽何感應<br />
To claim pure Yang as virgin male<br />
but cold a comfort lends<br />
但憐奇表最清揚<br />
The boast of purest outward mien<br />
mere pity does command.<br />
亮非走野風牛突<br />
Belike a bull that&rsquo;s penned away<br />
from field and wind will kick<br />
又豈奔泉渴鹿忙<br />
And would a thirsty stag forget<br />
toward a brook to bound?<br /></p>
</div>
<p>The emotional intimacy and longing as well as the strong desire in the relationship are made clear in the poem:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>但將款密期為友<br />
The deepest intimacy is<br />
true friendship&rsquo;s only path<br />
何忍須臾不共堂<br />
How could they merest moment&rsquo;s part-<br />
ing ever countenance?<br />
別去尋思如隔地<br />
Apart and deep in thought, &rsquo;tis like<br />
the earth were stoppered up<br />
訪來方抃況麾牆<br />
A visit met with claps, and is<br />
that waving from the fence?<br />
及當軒翥翔千里<br />
When stepping in the house he could<br />
fly all a thousand leagues<br />
得可從容宿一房<br />
All just to reach that single room<br />
and sleep in peaceful calm.<br /></p>
</div>
<p>The qualities of the young man Bak are praised in the poem as well, as a fitting match for the learned and accomplished Gonggong:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>矧此少年生早慧<br />
What&rsquo;s more, this boy despite his youth<br />
came early to be wise<br />
尤於博學飽曾嘗<br />
And breadth of learning made him in<br />
his studies a gourmand.<br />
宛如濯濯春林色<br />
His clean and shining light is like<br />
the sprouting green of spring<br />
正似團團望月光<br />
The rounded brilliance just like<br />
the full moon at a glance.<br /></p>
</div>
<p>The poem is unambiguous about the nature of the relationship, that there were not only emotional and intellectual but also sexual exchange as well.
The term daeshik, with the explicit reference to the Book of Han, leaves no question that this was a male homosexual relationship, given its usage in Korea and given that neither man was a maidservant or eunuch.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>寢底同衾情苟篤<br />
In single bedding they embrace<br />
in rest and love profound<br />
宮中對食效奚妨<br />
Who could their emulation of<br />
the courtly love infringe? [See the Book of Han]<br /></p>

<p>The 26th King of Goryeo, King Chungseon was the eldest son of King Chungryeol and Princess Supreme Jeguk, Borjigin Qutlugh Kelmysh daughter of Kubilai Khan.
Born after Goryeo&rsquo;s capitulation to the Mongol Chinese Empire of Yuan, Chungseon was the product of his father Chungryeol&rsquo;s strategic marriage to a Mongol princess to strengthen the royal family.
Chungseon himself would go on to marry a Mongol Princess, Princess Supreme Gyeguk, Borjigin Budashiri great-granddaughter of Kubilai Khan.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, King Chungseon&rsquo;s reign was never stable.
He was ousted and called to the Yuan court in favor of his father Chungryeol a mere eight months into his reign, and returned to the throne in Goryeo after Chungryeol&rsquo;s death.
This kind of instability would be a feature of Goryeo kingship during the period of Yuan interference, intensified by the ties of blood and marriage.
Only three months into his return as Goryeo&rsquo;s king he went back to the the Yuan court where he ruled from afar despite repeated requests from Goryeo to return, and would exercise heavy influence even after passing the throne onto his son King Chungsuk.
An active player in the Yuan Imperial Court, a collector of books and a promoter of scholarly exchange between Yuan and Goryeo, Chungseon was awarded princehood by Külüg Khan after helping the latter come to power, and was also exiled to Tibet in his later years during power struggles in the court before he returned and died in Yuan at the age of 50.</p>
<p>Chungseon had six queen consorts, ranging from his chief consort Princess Gyeguk, his second queen who was a Mongol woman not from the Imperial family, and four ethnic Korean queens.
He also had sexual relations with unnamed female servants, two of whom he is on record as gifting to his followers.
One of his mistresses was formerly his father Chungryeol&rsquo;s Royal Concubine Sukchang from the house of Kim.
Lady Kim was said to have been vain and extravagant, intervening in affairs of state and throwing a party during the mourning period for her own mother.</p>
<p>In addition to having many women Chungseon is described as &ldquo;greatly enjoying male love (多愛男色)&rdquo; and his favors, using the phrase the favors of yongyang (龍陽之寵), were given to Won Chung, a young man of no particular personal distinction from a high-ranking family.
Won Chung was called at age 18 by Chungseon to office greeting guests and managing the household.
At this point Chungseon was a prince-in-exile residing in Dàdū (modern-day Beijing), ousted from the Goryeo throne and in between his two reigns as King, though he was now in high favor with the Yuan court and would shortly be returning for his second reign.
Chungseon&rsquo;s favor was such that he gave Won Chung the royal surname of Wang and changed his name to Wang Ju.</p>
<p>However when Chungseon, two years into his return as King of Goryeo, tried to award Won Chung/Wang Ju even higher office, the man demurred saying he was neither experienced nor capable enough (he was not yet 20 at this time).
Angered, Chungseon took Won Chung&rsquo;s royal name away and demoted him.
The two men reconciled later on when Won Chung greeted Chungseon on his return from Yuan, coming all the way out to Goryeo&rsquo;s northern frontier of the Amnok River to meet him and treating him with care and courtesy the same as ever.
He eventually rose to the high office he had refused earlier and had the king&rsquo;s trust.</p>
<p>When Chungseon spoke to his son Chungsuk about Won Chung it was with praise, saying the man had served the royal family through generations and had ties through marriage, making him incomparable to other vassals.
Chungseon also told Won Chung to serve the king with loyalty forever.
Won Chung would go on to serve Chungseon&rsquo;s son Chungsuk and grandson Chunghye, rising to high office and going on diplomatic missions.
He was said to be restrained and diligent, taciturn, and a good administrator though he had little learning, and had three sons.</p>

</figure>

<p>The 31st King of Goryeo, he was a grandson of King Chungseon and functionally the last recognized king of Goryeo.
It should be noted that many scholars express skepticism on the accuracy of accounts on King Gongmin; the legitimacy of his heirs, or lack thereof, had a direct impact on that of the next dynasty, Joseon, which was when the <em>History of Goryeo</em> was compiled.
Nevertheless, there is no indication that these records were manufactured out of whole cloth, though readers should certainly be aware of biases from political agendas.
The necessity for such caution arguably holds true for all historical records.</p>
<p>Gongmin is widely known and admired in Korean history for breaking Goryeo away from the Yuan Empire&rsquo;s interference as Yuan&rsquo;s power waned.
He took back territory conquered by Yuan, and ceased the use of the Mongol empire&rsquo;s calendar and customs.
Internally, he purged pro-Yuan elements in court and resettled the balance of power by weakening the political control of the military leadership and nurturing a new generation of Confucian scholar-bureaucrats.
The latter, ironically, would be some of the main forces behind the founding of Joseon which would replace Goryeo.</p>
<p>The fall of Yuan and the turmoil in the Goryeo power structure, however, caused external and internal chaos that undermined any attempts to rule.
He had to flee the palace when hundreds of thousands of Red Turban rebels who had rose up against Yuan invaded Goryeo.
He survived internal rebellions and assassination attempts, and the purges and punishments he handed down as he grew increasingly suspicious only isolated him farther.</p>
<p>The queen who supported him unconditionally throughout his anti-Yuan independence policy and internal turmoil was the Mongol Princess Supreme Noguk of Yuan, born Borjigin Budashiri.
Like every king in his line since his great-grandfather Chungryeol he wedded a Yuan Princess for political backing, but the history is very clear that King Gongmin and his wife were deeply in love&mdash;and the historians were not always approving about it.
Their love is the stuff of legend in Korean history, such as the time the Princess Supreme sat before the doors to her husband&rsquo;s room to protect him from rebel assassins, a courage praised down the ages well into the Joseon era.
There is also a charming anecdote that Gongmin, an artist who disliked horseback riding and was the only king of Goryeo who did not hunt, practiced riding with the Princess at her behest during their displacement from court.</p>
<p>The fatal flaw in their love from a patriarchal perspective was Princess Noguk&rsquo;s infertility.
This couple had no children 15 years into their marriage, which was a source of instability and concern for the dynasty.
By itself this bad luck could generally be remedied by royal polygamy, but according to the <em>History of Goryeo</em> he never much enjoyed intimacy with women and his visits to Princess Noguk were very rare.
The Princess reluctantly and sorrowfully acquiesced to the king marrying a second queen 10 years into the childless marriage, but it appears he was not intimate with the other lady at all.</p>
<p>When the Princess finally fell pregnant with the couple&rsquo;s long-awaited child, such was Gongmin&rsquo;s desire for a safe birth that he pardoned prisoners and had temples and shrines across the kingdom pray for her.
Unfortunately she died during a difficult birth, and the baby died with her.
It was a catastrophe in an already unstable reign, often seen as the beginning of the end for the king both personally and politically.</p>
<p>The loss of a strong political backing from his marriage to the Princess led Gongmin to take drastic measures to carry on his reforms, the foremost of which was appointing Shin Don, a former monk with no noble background or bureaucratic qualification, to head those reforms.
Shin Don is called both a bold reformer who put brakes on the nobility&rsquo;s abuse of power and mistreatment of the people, and an illegitimate despot who himself abused the power given to him by an increasingly unstable king.
It was Gongmin himself who eventually turned on Shin Don by arresting and executing him on charges of treachery against the throne, and the reforms ultimately failed.</p>
<p>According to the framing of the <em>History of Goryeo,</em> which as seen in the caveat above may be biased for the political agenda of justifying the next dynasty, Gongmin&rsquo;s &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; grief for his beloved queen also contributed to the fall of his kingdom.
He started wasteful construction projects for her shrine, the size of which was an enormous drain on the already embattled kingdom&rsquo;s resources.
The work itself caused the deaths of workers and suffering for the populace from the literally monumental effort to carry the materials from afar and build the edifice.
He would take meals in front of her portrait, speaking to her as though to a living wife, and his continued refusal to be intimate with his other wives meant he had no heir.
When asked by his mother eight years after the Princess&rsquo;s death why he did not frequent his queen consorts&rsquo; chambers, he replied weeping that there were none like the Princess, which his mother reprimanded as shameful and excessive grief.</p>
<p>According to the records he was not, however, adverse to intimacy with men.
The <em>History of Goryeo</em> records King Gongmin gathering young men from good families around him as his personal bodyguard, the Jajewi, on whom he bestowed numerous favors.
Some see this as analogous to the decade Gongmin himself spent as a young prince at Yuan court as an imperial bodyguard and hostage.
He also had a male lover, Kim Heung-gyeong, who received the king&rsquo;s yongyang favor and high office.
He was also placed in charge of the Jajewi.</p>
<p>The <em>History of Goryeo</em> records the Jajewi doing &ldquo;wanton and filthy&rdquo; deeds for the king&rsquo;s favor, which included sex with the king but was not described in the refined language of yongyang or even namsaek, perhaps because the sex acts with the men in question were not considered befitting a high-ranking man&rsquo;s dignity.
This allegedly consisted of the king putting on women&rsquo;s cosmetics, ordering the young men of the Jajewi to have sex with a young servant girl while he watched from the next room, and then having the men do &ldquo;wanton deeds unto him as to a woman.&rdquo;
This seems to imply being a recipient of penetration (i.e. a bottom), considered in many cultures to be shameful and submissive for a man of dominant status where being the penetrator of a man was acceptable.</p>
<p>According to the record, Gongmin also planned to resolve the problem of begetting an heir by having these young bodyguards rape his queens, something the ladies resisted threatening suicide but one of them relented when Gongmin threatened her at swordpoint.
These actions became the king&rsquo;s downfall when she fell pregnant from the rapes by Hong Ryun, a leading member of the Jajewi.
Gongmin, on being told by a eunuch Choi Mansaeng about the pregnancy, announced that he would have Hong Ryun killed&mdash;and then, inexplicably, told Choi Mansaeng that <em>he</em> would be killed as well for knowing this.
Somewhat unsurprisingly, Choi Mansaeng and Hong Ryun later burst into Gongmin&rsquo;s bedchamber where the king was in drunken slumber and stabbed him to death.</p>
<p>Though Gongmin did have a son, or said he did, there were so many doubts cast on the boy&rsquo;s birth that he never gained legitimacy and was ultimately executed by the rising coalition of soldiers and scholars who would ultimately bring down Goryeo and found the new kingdom of Joseon.
Gongmin never mentioned the boy until a few years after his birth, claiming he had made a royal visit to the late Shin Don&rsquo;s home where he lay with a female servant of Shin Don, Banya, who later gave birth to a boy.
After Shin Don&rsquo;s execution Gongmin brought the boy to the palace to be raised as a prince and be his heir, but even taking his story at face value the boy Wu had no right to be the king&rsquo;s heir because he was born outside recognized marriage or concubinage.
As it were, many doubted Wu&rsquo;s paternity and both Wu and his son Chang were later executed, and were called Shin Wu and Shin Chang as descendants of Shin Don rather than the royal surname of Wang.</p>
<p>Though we might not be able to take all of the <em>History of Goryeo</em> at face value especially at the end of the dynasty, by the <em>History&rsquo;s</em> framing King Gongmin&rsquo;s favors and immoral acts with men, together with an aversion to physical intimacy with women, perhaps compounded by what was viewed as an unusual and shameful level of affection for an infertile&mdash;and later dead&mdash;queen, contributed to the instability and fall of his kingdom.
It should be noted that a king having male lovers was not in itself problematic or unusual in the eyes of the history writers, but rather the shameful nature of some of these sexual acts together with the attempt to adulterate the royal line through cuckoldry.</p>

<h2 id="sossang-and-danji--15th-century--enslaved-women-in-a-known-sexual-relationship">Sossang and Danji (15th century): Enslaved women in a known sexual relationship</h2>
<p>Sossang and Danji were servants in the palace of the Joseon dynasty in its early years.
Sossang was a servant of the palace, meaning she was indentured to the state, while Danji was a private servant in the household of one of the Crown Prince&rsquo;s royal concubines.</p>
<p>According to the record, Sossang and Danji were in love and sometimes slept together, leaving no doubt that the relationship was sexual in nature.
The Crown Princess Consort at the time from the house of Bong, when later interrogated by her father-in-law the king, described how Sossang and Danji not only slept together at night but also embraced neck to neck and sucked each others&rsquo; tongues because they were &ldquo;always loving and joyful (常時愛好)&rdquo; with each other, in what may be the only surviving description of consenting erotic activity between women from premodern Korea.</p>
<p>Neither Sossang nor Danji had full freedom to marry of their own volition as enslaved persons, though enslavers might give their blessings or at least tolerate male-female unions involving the persons they had enslaved.
Nevertheless, it seemed these two had some space to have a relationship with each other which, if technically illegitimate, was at least a known phenomenon and one that was not particularly more stringently punished than male-female adultery, as discussed below.</p>
<p>Such female homosexual relationships and the women in them were almost never recorded, and the reason we know these two particular women&rsquo;s names and their relationship is because the aforementioned Crown Princess Consort Bong developed a sexual interest in Sossang and, per Sossang&rsquo;s accusation, raped the servant &ldquo;in form similar to a man lying with a woman.&rdquo;
The Crown Princess also stalked and spied on Sossang and Danji to keep them apart, and jealously kept the fearful Sossang by her side.</p>
<p>This coerced sexual relationship between the Princess Consort and Sossang became known to the palace, and as it was adultery by the Princess Consort against her husband the Crown Prince, it was viewed as a violation of the royal family&rsquo;s dignity and integrity and ultimately became the reason for the Princess&rsquo;s expulsion from her position.
The King considered the adultery with Sossang too shameful to publicly state as a reason for the expulsion, however, and named the Princess&rsquo;s other misdeeds instead, such as jealousy of her husband&rsquo;s concubines, peering at people outside through the servants&rsquo; outhouse walls, and improper handling of royal property.</p>
<p>The king who made this decision, Sejong, professed a particular hatred for such illegitimate assignations between female servants, enslaved women and others, and discussed how he would have them corporeally punished by 70 blows to the buttocks and 100 more on repeat offenses.
Given that these punishments used large wooden paddles, such beatings could result in not only injury but disability and even death.
Believing that Heaven had guided his heart to hate the practice of female homosexuality, he boasted of reducing this custom with such strict measures.
However, this was certainly not the last instance of recorded female homosexuality in the Joseon palace, as  later discussed.</p>

<p>For context, it does not appear that female homosexuality was a particularly greater crime than illicit male-female sex.
In the <em>Great Laws of Ming (大明律)</em>, the criminal code of the Chinese Ming dynasty that became the basis of Joseon criminal law, the basic punishment for illegitimate sex between a man and woman who were not married to each other was 80 blows for both the man and woman, or 90 blows for a married woman.</p>
<p>Of course, it is doubtful that the law was enforced for unmarried men and women who had consenting sex, for both lack of social stigma for such activities and limitations in state resources.
However, Sejong&rsquo;s own prohibition of relationships between palace servants was not a blanket ban on female homosexuality throughout the land of Joseon either, but rather took place in the specific context of the palace which was at the center and source of the kingdom&rsquo;s Confucian rule, where even unmarried servants were held to a standard of conduct befitting the dignity of the royal household.</p>

<p>Also during the time of Sejong, a nobleman named Yi Seon was given high office and put in charge of Joseon&rsquo;s military.
The record of his promotion states three main points against Yi Seon&rsquo;s character that made him unfit for office, in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He is small-minded, stubborn, strange-tempered, arrogant, and is neither capable himself nor trusting of colleagues and subordinates, and thus almost always ruins the work wherever he goes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has a handsome male slave who he keeps in a room as he would a wife or concubine, who is indeed known in the neighborhood as Lord Yi&rsquo;s concubine.
This slave even goes willfully into the marital bedroom and sleeps with Yi Seon&rsquo;s wife, with the noise audible from the outside, something Yi Seon neither prohibits nor minds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has his servants go around digging under the walls of his neighbors, causing the neighbors to move away when the walls cave, and he promptly incorporates these lands as fields attached to his own compound.
He also incorporated a formerly communal well by putting a human corpse next to it and then walling it around when people stopped coming.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The perceived sexual inappropriateness of allowing his male lover to commit adultery with his wife, it seems, was considered to be equivalent with other character flaws of incompetence and avarice in one of the highest officials in the land.
This was not considered a criminal offense, however, (though the handling of property may well have constituted a crime if laws were properly enforced) nor even a disqualification given that Yi Seon continued to serve in high office.</p>

<h2 id="lady-bak--15th-century--manufactured-allegations-of-affairs-with-maidservants">Lady Bak (15th century): Manufactured allegations of affairs with maidservants</h2>
<p>A lady from the house Bak, the wife of Prince Je-an of the royal family, was alleged to have been in affairs with three maidservants.
Lady Bak herself maintained her innocence, saying that it was the maidservants who tried to seduce her, forcibly kissed her, and touched her breasts without her consent.</p>
<p>Under interrogation a maidservant confessed that the prince&rsquo;s nurse was behind it, trying to frame Lady Bak so the prince could remarry his former wife.
In the end, despite the lady&rsquo;s proven innocence, Prince Je-an convinced his kinsman King Seongjong to let him divorce Lady Bak and remarry his divorced wife Lady Kim.
Though this is not a case of consensual homosexual activity between women, it shows that female homosexuality was a known practice and was potentially marriage-ending and incriminating much like adultery with a man.</p>

<p>Palace attendants (內人, na&rsquo;in) and senior ladies (尙宮, sanggung) were a different class of women from the enslaved women who served at the palace, though in a broad sense they might all be called palace attendants (宮女 gungnyeo, 宮人 gung-in).
In the narrow sense, palace attendants were not menial laborers of the palace but professional assistants, craftswomen, and cooks who had their own maidservants.
The attendants were taught to read and write Hangul, and served the royals close by or were in charge of the royals&rsquo; food, clothing, and decorations.
The sanggung, meanwhile, were the senior management who gave orders to the na&rsquo;in.
The term &ldquo;attendants,&rdquo; for the purpose of this section, refers to this narrow sense of more elite palace workers, and will include the sanggung because they were promoted from the ranks of na&rsquo;in.</p>
<p>Attendants were born from a range of different classes, from enslaved to nobility.
Their special functions in the palace set them apart with certain significant benefits such as higher wages than most women of the time could command, social status, and a degree of leisure.
These privileges also entailed many restrictions, a major one being that they could not leave the palace except on special occasions, when expelled, or when sick or close to death.
Another was that they were forbidden to marry as they were technically sexually committed and available to the king, though this remained theoretical for almost all of these women and in practice it meant enforced celibacy.
Adultery with men was punishable by death, for instance.</p>
<p>There are seeming allegations of adultery with women as well, that is between each other or with outside women, though the references are not entirely clear and an oft-cited example does not appear to be about homosexuality at all.
That is, though it was alleged by some modern commentators that the reference in late 15th-century records to attendants sharing friendship (gyobung) with each other meant female homosexuality, punishable by being branded with the words &ldquo;illegal friendship (違法交朋), an examination of the primary record does not indicate anything sexual about these illegal friendships and the punishment for them but rather factionism/partisanship and breach of palace security.</p>
<p>Gyobung has been used elsewhere in the records in a political sense referring to &ldquo;factions of friends (朋堂)&rdquo; meaning partisanship that was widely decried as a source of political disorder and corruption.
The complaint about palace attendants&rsquo; gyobung, furthermore, was about attendants forming factions and leaking palace secrets, and from my reading there was no sexual content to these accusations.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
Nevertheless, given the listing of gyobung as a term for female homosexuality and leaving open the possibility that I may have missed some nuances and references as a non-expert researcher, I am mentioning these passages and linking to the online database entry so others may judge for themselves.</p>
<p>A somewhat likelier reference to female homosexuality by palace attendants is a complaint from the 18th century that attendants were consorting with crafty Buddhist nuns and lowborn widows and calling it daeshik.
Daeshik, as discussed above in the terminology section, means sharing meals together, in this context visits by friends from outside the palace, and was also a widespread term in premodern Korea for homosexuality.</p>
<p>In full context this complaint may also refer to the need for order and secrecy in the palace, as the immediately preceding passage discusses corruption and the leakage of palace secrets.
The use of the term daeshik is nevertheless suggestive, and may have been a veiled reference to the entwined problems of corruption, security breaches, and sexual inappropriateness in the palace.
This may have been as close to a reference as propriety allowed in open court.
This is in contrast to the passages involving Princess Consort Bong&rsquo;s rape of the maidservant Sossang, which recorded consultations made in secret between Sejong and his closest advisors because the matter was so sensitive.
Certainly, given how widespread the use of &ldquo;daeshik&rdquo; was, it is unlikely that a classically educated audience of courtiers were ignorant of the innuendo.</p>
<p>It is further worth noting that the crafty nuns and lowborn widows referenced in the complaint are female counterparts to the &ldquo;common ruffians and unseemly monks&rdquo; referenced by Yi Gyu-gyeong while discussing male homosexuality, see next section.
In this way, the daeshik custom between palace attendants presents a window into female homosexuality in other sections of society as well, where despite the kingdom&rsquo;s repressive mores the people were subject to far  less direct control in sexual matters.</p>
<p>As also noted in the section on Sossang and Danji, prohibitions and penalties were not unique to female homosexuality in a palace setting, with prohibitions against adultery with men being at least as heavy.
In fact by the time of King Yeongjo, when the above complaint was made, the laws had become considerably stricter for palace attendants who consorted with outside men, a crime made punishable by beheading both the man and woman in Yeongjo&rsquo;s time as opposed to corporeal punishment for sexual activity with women mentioned in Sejong&rsquo;s time three hundred years before.
There is no evidence of a ban on homosexuality, male or female, for the general populace.</p>
<p>Via Kang (2015), a number of scholars in the 18th and 19th centuries delved into the history of and terms for homosexuality, such as the origin and meaning of terms such as daeshik and namchong.
Of these, Yi Hakgyu explained the meaning of daeshik as a part of palace affairs and mentioned that it was quite popular at the time, providing farther record of daeshik as a continuing practice in the Joseon dynasty.</p>

<h2 id="ruffians-and-monks--18th-19th-centuries--practitioners-of-male-homosexuality">Ruffians and monks (18th-19th centuries): Practitioners of male homosexuality</h2>
<p>Yi Gyugyeong was an 18th to 19th century scholar whose greatest single work is the <em>Oju Yeonmun Jangjeon San-go</em> (五洲衍文長箋散稿), an encyclopedic compilation of over 1,400 entries comprising knowledge from around the world on a plethora of subjects from history and antiquity to science and agriculture.
Homosexuality was one of the many subjects Yi Gyugyeong wrote about, and in exploring the history of namchong with examples from China and Japan, he ends the article on a note critical of homosexuality.
&ldquo;Who says this is a beautiful custom to be shared across the world?
In our eastern land [Joseon], it is merely taught and learned among common ruffians and unseemly monks at temples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This offhand disapproving comment provides a window into the classes of men who were thought to engage in male homosexuality.
Together with the above-discussed complaints of &ldquo;crafty nuns and lowborn widows&rdquo; as purveyors of daeshik, it may be indicative of the intertwining of class and position with sexual inappropriateness such as homosexuality:
The unpropertied, unmarrigeable, and monastic outside the strict Confucian order built on the ideal of a propertied male-headed household.</p>
<p>Given the long and widespread practice of homosexuality in Korea, however, Yi Gyugyeong&rsquo;s claim of its confinement to certain defined and despised classes seems more based on ideal than fact.
Kings during the Goryeo dynasty were in open homosexual relationships, and a leading literary talent of the day wrote in praise of homosexual love.
Even in the early Joseon period there were high-ranking officials in open homosexual relationships, and there are persistent records of working-class women engaging in female homosexuality in the royal palace of Joseon.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Records from premodern Korea going back over 1,000 years attest to the existence of people who did not conform to strict ideas of cisnormativity and heteronormativity.
While the existence of homosexual, bisexual, and gender non-conforming people is a constant, there have been different understandings of attitudes toward their proclivities, from a gender inversion by Heaven to refined courtly love to social disorder and adultery against the King.
Queer people have always been here and are no Western invention, and understandings of our existence will always be contextual and dynamic.
One constant seems to be that the open existence of queer people outside of narrow constraints is construed as a threat to prevailing orders of patriarchy and property, or outside or parallel to such dominant order.
This may be the ultimate subsersive promise of queerness.
If queerness can threaten and dismantle kingdoms, what are the other possibilities?</p>

      <title>The Feminist Pansori</title>

      <description>Pansori, a musical form born in openly misogynistic 17th-century Korea, recognizes and celebrates the humanity and worth of women in culturally and historically specific ways.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="pansori">Pansori?</h2>
<p>Pansori is a Korean musical form developed from around the 17th century, where one person sings and makes commentary following a set story to the accompaniment of a drummer.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://ljwrites.blog/img/pansori/Korea-Busan_3404-06_Pansori.jpeg"
         alt="A female-presenting person in traditional Korean hanbok holding a closed fan stands before a painted screen, with a male-presenting person in hanbok sitting off to the right playing a drum."/> 
</figure>

<p>There are five traditional repertoires that have survived to the present day: Chunhyangga (The Song of Chunhyang), Shimcheongga (The Song of Shim Cheong), Sugungga (The Song of the Sea Palace), Jeokbyeokga (The Song of the Red Cliffs), and Heungboga (The Song of Heungbo).
In this post, I&rsquo;ll be discussing some of the story elements of Chunhyangga, Shimcheongga, and Sugungga.</p>
<p><strong>Content warning:</strong> The sections below contain discussions of dark subject matter including violence, death, and poverty.
More detailed warnings are given by section.</p>
<h2 id="chunhyangga-a-love-story-of-self-determination-and-respect">Chunhyangga: A love story of self-determination and respect</h2>
<p><strong>Content warning:</strong> Attempted sexual coercion, imprisonment, torture</p>
<p>Chunhyangga is the love story of teenagers Seong Chunhyang, who is the daughter of a retired gisaeng (courtesan), and Yi Mongryong, the son of a noble family.
Theirs are most certainly not two households both alike in dignity; in patriarchal and class-stratified Joseon Dynasty terms Chunhyang does not even <em>have</em> a house worth the name, for she has no father and the head of her family is a woman once indentured to the state to provide entertainment services.
Although Chunhyang&rsquo;s mother Wolmae retired in success and relative wealth and is no longer bound to be a courtesan, nor is Chunhyang herself formally a courtesan, her low birth still makes her vulnerable to abuse of power as the story will demonstrate.</p>
<p>Chunhyang and Mongryong meet and fall in love when Mongryong&rsquo;s father is appointed the governor of fair Namwon, where we lay our scene, a real town in Korea and a holy site to the art of pansori to this day.
Smitten, the two 16-year-olds declare themselves man and wife but their union cannot possibly be officially recognized due to the gaping chasm between their stations.
In Joseon, a kingdom whose founding order depended on a strict social hierarchy, at best Chunhyang could be Mongryong&rsquo;s concubine if he cared enough to keep her around.</p>
<p>The first calamity strikes our young lovers when Mongryong&rsquo;s father is called away to Hanyang (present-day Seoul) where Chunhyang cannot follow because, again, she was not a legally sanctioned wife.
Mongryong might have been able to take her with him if he were respectably married to a noblewoman and was the head of his own household, but as an officially unmarried boy he was part of his father&rsquo;s household and had to go where his father went.
The two part tearfully, promising to be faithful to each other, and Chunhyang begins her long wait for him, mourning their parting and hoping for him to return to her a successful man so that they can be together.
In the terms of the times this meant passing the state examination and winning high office.</p>
<p>The second and even worse disaster strikes in the form of the man who succeeds Mongryong&rsquo;s father as governor of Namwon: Byeon Hakdo.
A corrupt and lustful man, he hears of Chunhyang&rsquo;s famed beauty and just as famous virtue and commands her to attend to him as a courtesan.
This, even though she is not on the courtesan register and is legally a free woman.
She also considers herself married, to a nobleman at that, and will not pour drinks and smile for another man.</p>
<p>None of that is any protection against Byeon Hakdo&rsquo;s abuse of power, however, and when Chunhyang continues to refuse him he has her imprisoned and beaten into unconsciousness.
He imprisons her, declaring she would be put to death on his upcoming birthday for the crime of refusing him as a mere lowborn woman.</p>
<p>It is at this point, the night before Chunhyang&rsquo;s scheduled execution, that the long-awaited Lee Mongryong returns to Namwon&ndash;but at night, as a ragged itinerant whose once-proud house has fallen.
Wolmae, on seeing him, screams that her daughter Chunhyang is dead, for her one last hope of salvation is gone.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mongryong convinces his mother-in-law to let him see Chunhyang in prison, and the lovers have a touching reunion scene where Chunhyang, injured, imprisoned, and waiting to die, declares he is her love no matter what the circumstance and defends him to her irate and grieving mother.
All Chunhyang asks is that she be buried as Mongryong&rsquo;s faithful wife on his family&rsquo;s funerary grounds, his castoff clothes covering her in the coffin.</p>
<p>Morning comes, and Chunhyang is dragged before the governor Byeon Hakdo to be executed.
He tries one last time to get her to relent, offering to spare her life if she will do as he commands, and she refuses to the last.
Just as she is about to be killed, the troops of the King&rsquo;s Secret Inspector strike, arresting Byeon and his cronies.
Chunhyang, saved from the executioner&rsquo;s blade, comes face-to-face with the Inspector&ndash;her self-declared husband Lee Mongryong, who had returned in disguise hiding his high office to root out Byeon&rsquo;s abuses of power and to save her.
She is given a special dispensation to marry him, not as his concubine but as his lawful noble wife, and her virtue is praised throughout the land.</p>
<p>Within the limitations of the time and society it arose from, then,  Chunhyangga tells a deeply subversive, and of course fantastical and impossible, story of a lowborn woman daring to assert her own will, her own love and self-determination, in the face of power and have it legitimized by the broader society.
These are revolutionary ideas, though the story they appear in fits them into terms friendly to the existing order.</p>
<p>Though heavily mediated and limited by the patriarchal social system of the time, the themes of women&rsquo;s sexual and romantic autonomy free of the bounds of class are unmistakable.
Yes, obviously, it is not feminism as we recognize it for a woman&rsquo;s sexual and romantic decisions to be validated only if she is a free woman recognized as a nobleman&rsquo;s wife and guards her sexual loyalty with her literal life.
But if we call privilege by its true name, that is the granting of full humanity, we get a glimpse at the idea behind Chunhyang&rsquo;s story&ndash;a woman&rsquo;s yearning for respect as a person, which in the times she lived in and for her gender was only possible in partial form for a virtuous noblewoman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that while the governor Byeon Hakdo&rsquo;s downfall for his corruption and cruelty is a political and subversive plotline, it is focused and mediated through his coercion and violence against the heroine.
The governor&rsquo;s persecution of Chunhyang is the main dramatic reason we want him to fall, and we want Mongryong to succeed because he is the man Chunhyang loves and the key to saving her life.</p>
<p>Misogynist violence, therefore, is not a side political issue in the story as it is often treated in real life.
Violence against women is THE political issue the story gets the audience to care about.
The governor is obviously corrupt and exploitative in numerous other ways, but it is his treatment of a lovestruck, brave, steadfast girl that brings his evil into full focus and gets us to root for this corrupt official&rsquo;s downfall.
This ties into the broader political subversiveness of pansori, which is outside the scope of this post but deserves mention as far as it touches on the theme of women&rsquo;s humanity and worth.</p>
<p>I will say that there is a parallel in the political subversiveness of pansori to the theme of women&rsquo;s autonomy in that the political subversiveness also dovetails into the existing order by use of fantasy.
In this case it&rsquo;s the fantasy that the political order under the King is a force for good that ends injustice and corruption, saving victims like Chunhyang.
This is not historical fact, of course, much as a courtesan&rsquo;s daughter becoming a noble wife was impossible in real life.
But again, this was a story told within the limitations of its times, often using fantastical elements to fit the events of the story into the worldview of the time.</p>
<h2 id="shimcheongga-a-father-as-his-daughter-s-all-loving-all-giving-caregiver">Shimcheongga: A father as his daughter&rsquo;s all-loving, all-giving caregiver</h2>
<p><strong>Content warning:</strong> Bereavement, human sacrifice, poverty, societal misogyny, breasts and breastfeeding</p>
<p>Shimcheongga tells the story of Shim Cheong and her daughterly love for her father Shim Hak-gyu.
The most famous part of the story is that Cheong sells herself as a human sacrifice so her father can afford a sizable donation to a Buddhist temple, a good deed that is promised to give her blind father his sight.</p>
<p>The love and devotion is hardly one way, however.
The actual story of Cheong and her father begins with, well, her birth of course, but the joy is swiftly and devastatingly eclipsed by her mother&rsquo;s death only a week later.
Cheong&rsquo;s mother Lady Gwak, a skilled seamstress, was the breadwinner of the family where Hak-gyu could not work due to his disability.
The death of the wife meant economic disaster for the family, especially since the couple had plowed their fortune into tithes and offerings trying to conceive a child at past forty.
With that fond dream realized, however, the tragedy of the new mother&rsquo;s death meant the father and infant daughter were staring down the barrel of imminent destitution and starvation.</p>
<p>Fortunately the community come through for this vulnerable family, and interestingly it&rsquo;s all women who are mentioned as helping them.
Centuries before the availability of baby formula and without the money to hire a wet nurse, baby Cheong would have starved to death without breastmilk.
When Hak-gyu goes out to the village well begging milk for his infant daughter, those of the village women who are lactating feed her themselves, saying they&rsquo;d rather let their own children go hungry than this poor thing.
Women with no milk give money, while women without money give rice.
It is also the community who feed this father and daughter throughout her childhood and teenage years as they beg food which is freely given to them.</p>
<p>Shimcheongga, then, begins with the story of a widowed single father, disabled and destitute, doing everything he can to raise his daughter&ndash;a daughter who was, in the terms of the time, a useless liability who would not be able to carry on his name or support him in his old age.</p>
<p>This point is actually foregrounded very early in the story, at Cheong&rsquo;s birth when her mother is still healthy.
Having had Cheong when the couple were both in their forties, Lady Gwak asks Hak-gyu if he isn&rsquo;t aggrieved that the only child they&rsquo;ll have is a girl.
The overjoyed father answers, not at all!
After all, Cheong can marry a good man and have sons who will support their maternal grandparents.
While constrained by the imagination of a heavily sexist time, the story nevertheless foregrounds the contributions women make to the welfare of their aged parents.</p>
<p>Besides, you can tell the conventional idea of girls being supposedly a burden is belied from the start of the story with Lady Gwak being the breadwinner of the household who supported her husband and, later, paid for the age&rsquo;s equivalent of fertility treatments.
Shim Cheong herself, at the age of ten, takes over the food-begging duties from her father at her own insistence and does better than him at it.</p>
<p>Shimcheongga, in other words, subverts gender roles with a father as his daughter&rsquo;s primary caregiver, and by also showing women as economic actors with agency.
Even more than that, it argues that women have inherent worth and are deserving of care and devotion through this story of a motherless girl who would have died without her father&rsquo;s and her community&rsquo;s loving care and generosity.</p>
<h2 id="sugungga-rabbit-revolutionary-dot">Sugungga: Rabbit, revolutionary.</h2>
<p><strong>Content warning:</strong> Attempted sacrifice and mutilation, body gendering, genitals</p>
<p>Sugungga, the most satirical of the five classic repertoires, has a female protagonist (or villain, depending) in the sense of a female animal.
In the story the Sea King falls ill and his trusted retainer, Terrapin, sets out to land to capture a rabbit whose liver the Sea King must eat in order to heal.
After a mishap with calling a Tiger instead of a Rabbit, the Terrapin finally meets and tricks Rabbit to the Sea Palace, luring it with promises of high office and honors.
At the Sea Palace the true purpose of the visit is revealed, and Rabbit is told it will be killed so the Sea King can be cured.
But not to worry, it&rsquo;ll be remembered and honored forever for its noble sacrifice!</p>
<p>Rabbit, instead of quaking in fear, claims it can live without a liver.
In fact, it takes out its liver every moon!
This happens to be one of the times Rabbit had its liver out, and it needs to go back to land to fetch the organ.
As proof of this unlikely tale Rabbit points out that it has three holes down there&ndash;one for pissing, one for crapping, and one to take its liver out and put it back.
Rabbit claims it is happy to hand some of its liver over to the Sea King and enjoy the high honors he will bestow in exchange.
The Sea King falls for this and Terrapin takes Rabbit back to land.
Of course Rabbit, once safely back on hand, mocks Terrapin soundly for its gullibility and runs off.</p>
<p>I mean the &ldquo;three holes&rdquo; part is a ruse that a crowd better versed in mammal anatomy would never have fallen for; it&rsquo;s pretty obvious to a landbound audience what the &ldquo;third hole&rdquo; is for and it wasn&rsquo;t for taking out any liver.
In this sense, the Terrapin&rsquo;s misadventures with the Tiger early on comes across like foreshadowing, with most versions saying it escaped by biting the tiger&rsquo;s balls.
This symbolism rings all the truer because in Korean folktale Tiger and Rabbit are often contrasted as symbols of the foolishness of the powerful and the wisdom of the powerless.
It would not be a stretch to read gender into that symbolism, with Tiger as a strong, aggressive man and Rabbit as a physically weak but witty woman.</p>
<p>The way Rabbit is tricked into almost being killed so the Sea King might live is also reminiscent of the way patriarchal systems, and in this case the Neo-Confucian hierarchy of this time, demand sacrifices of women.
Given that &ldquo;give out the liver and gallbladder&rdquo; is a common Korean expression for being a doormat without boundaries or the courage to say no, the entire premise of the story reads as satire for what believing the promises of the powerful does to you:
You&rsquo;re promised honor and prestige, and end up losing your selfhood and your very life.
Rabbit itself was lured by the false promises of patriarchy before it had a rude awakening of the system&rsquo;s true nature, and had to use its wits to survive that situation.</p>
<p>The story in this reading seems to ask, are you really going to give away your liver to a system that benefits only powerful men, and consent to live as a corpse with no will of your own, &ldquo;cherished&rdquo; in loving memory not as a vital, living being but for how you were deceived and exploited?
The story also exposes the true nature of hierarchies like the patriarchy, that they ultimately depend on taking people&rsquo;s will and lives, deceiving them into bargains that serve none but the powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a message so subversive that it could only be told in metaphor:
Where Chunhyangga and Shimcheongga paid at least lip service to Confucian values including the beneficience of the King and familial piety, Sugungga, in the realm of talking animals and supernatural beings, fully took off the gloves and pilloried the sacred social values of the times.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an interesting contrast to be drawn between Shim Cheong&rsquo;s willingly becoming a human sacrifice for her father and Rabbit&rsquo;s refusal to sacrifice for the Sea King.
As discussed at length above, Cheong was giving her life for a father who had lovingly raised her in difficult circumstances, while Rabbit had no intention of dying for a king that it had no relationship with and who had no claim to its loyalty.
Though both sacrifices might be laudable in the logic of the worlds they take place in, in the case of Sugungga it would have been a hollow virtue without any grounding in reciprocal and loving relationships.
That difference gives us room to think about how virtues in a hierarchical social system can be connected to emotional values with resonance, ones that we might be able to expand on and adapt without keeping the whole oppressive structure.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>No one is suggesting that these stories about a woman willing to be executed to be loyal to an absent husband, another woman who dove to her death for her father, and talking animals in an underwater palace are the pinnacle of Western-style modern feminism.
What they do show is that the recognition of female autonomy and worth existed in Korean society far before full contact with the U.S. and Europe, and these ideas were not new to Koreans nor given to us wholesale by the West.
The specific expressions may differ, but the feminist yearnings, the desire of women to be recognized as fully human and live on our own terms, has always been there as seen in this small glimpse of Korean art.
It&rsquo;s a heritage worthy of rediscovery and interpretation as we look to exploring a myriad of different feminisms, each in our cultural, historical, and social contexts.</p>

      <title>  No, Andrew Lee Is Not the &#34;Crown Prince of Korea&#34; (there is someone who comes close, though)
  </title>
      <link>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/crown-prince-korea/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ljwrites.blog/posts/crown-prince-korea/</guid>
      <description>The Korean-American businessman Andrew Lee is not the Crown Prince of Korea. The last Crown Prince of Korea has a living heir, though.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was amused to read that Andrew Lee, the claimed &ldquo;Crown Prince of Korea,&rdquo; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/freenode-irc-has-been-taken-over-by-the-crown-prince-of-korea/">took over the Freenode IRC network</a>.
I mean, not the part where he took over Freenode, of course, which is a shame and I hope users will find a better home if he can&rsquo;t be removed.</p>
<p>The part that amused me was that he claimed to be the Crown Prince of Korea, because a) that title doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore because neither Korea is a monarchy anymore&ndash;or at least not the same monarchy, in the case of the North&ndash;and b) to the extent it exists, it belongs to someone else entirely and Andrew Lee has no claim to it.</p>
<p>Why is that, and who is the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Crown Prince of Korea?
Dive down that rabbit hole with me if you like royal family trivia and/or history.</p>
<h2 id="andrew-lee-the-case-for-and-against">Andrew Lee: The case for and against</h2>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s look at Andrew Lee&rsquo;s claim to this title.
The claim is that Yi Seok, a grandson of Gojong who was the last king of Joseon and the first Emperor of the Daehan Empire, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/andrew-lee-named-new-korean-crown-prince-300731986.html">passed on</a> the title to Lee in October of 2018.
(&ldquo;Lee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yi&rdquo; are romanizations of the same Korean surname 이(李). I will use &ldquo;Yi&rdquo; for Korean names because it is the more modern and phonetically correct one.
I will also put the surname first for Korean names.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that Yi Seok is one of the grandsons of Emperor Gojong and a member of the royal family.
He is not, however, in the direct line of the last Crown Prince of Korea, and therefore cannot pass the title on.
It&rsquo;s also been pointed out that Andrew Lee has never made clear what his family ties to Yi Seok or the Korean royal family are, and if he is not a member of the royal family he is not eligible for any royal title in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-crown-prince--sort-of">The real Crown Prince (sort of)</h2>
<p>So is there an actual Crown Prince of Korea?
Well, technically, no.
The last guy to hold the title died in 1970 and he lost the title itself in 1910 when Japan took over Korea, and it was never restored because the monarchy was abolished.
The title of Crown Prince, in other words, has not existed in 110 years and the last person to hold it has been dead for over 50.</p>
<p>But also, sort-of kind-of, yes?
While the former royal family, the Yi family from Jeonju, no longer holds political power in Korea (individuals might, of course, but due to being elected in their personal capacity and not by family affiliation), the eldest man in the direct line of the former Crown Prince is acknowledged as the head of the family and holds rites for the royal ancestors.
His title is not Crown Prince, however, far less King, but the Rite-Giver (봉사자, 奉祀子) for the Daehan Royal Family.
As the former royal family they&rsquo;ve decided to recognize the royal line and pay respects to the old kings, a millennia-old tradition in cases where a royal family that lost power survives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strictly private title, of course, and has nothing to do with official government designation or power.
The Jeonju Yi family as a private association could call a dancing monkey their Rite-Giver and would be perfectly within their legal rights to do so.
They could also call the monkey (or anyone they chose) the Crown Prince and it would be as legal as it is officially meaningless, much like Andrew Lee&rsquo;s title.</p>
<p>The head of the former royal family and their Rite-Giver is not a monkey.</p>
<p>Nor is it Yi Seok or Andrew Lee.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this guy:</p>

<p>This is Yi Won, great-grandson of Gojong and grandson of Yi Eun, the aforementioned last Crown Prince of Korea.
Or, if you go by legally recognized terms, the grandson of Yi Gang, Yi Eun&rsquo;s brother.
I told you this was a rabbit hole.</p>
<h2 id="dot-dot-dot-why">&hellip;Why?</h2>
<p>But wait, didn&rsquo;t I say Yi Seok is a son of Yi Gang, making him Yi Won&rsquo;s uncle?
So why is Yi Won ahead of him in the family&rsquo;s pecking order?
Also what&rsquo;s this about Yi Won having two different grandfathers?</p>
<p>This all goes back to the three sons of Gojong, who was the 26th king of Joseon and first Emperor of the Daehan Empire.
Gojong&rsquo;s eldest surviving son Cheok became Sunjong, the second and soon last Emperor when Japan took over the country in 1910.
Sunjong had no son, so his Crown Prince was his younger half-brother Yi Eun, the last person to hold this title.</p>
<p>These two princes&rsquo; half-brother, Yi Gang, had a whopping 21 children.
The 10th son is Yi Seok while the 9th son, Yi Gab, had two sons and a daughter, the eldest son being Yi Won.</p>
<p>Here comes the family tree, a vastly simplified one of course that omits everyone who is not directly mentioned in this particular story (siblings arranged left to right in birth order):</p>

         alt="A family tree diagram showing Gojong (Emperor) with three children below, Sunjong (Emperor), Yi Gang, and Yi Eun (Crown Prince) from left to right. Below Yi Gang are Yi Gab and Yi Seok. Below Yi Gab is Yi Won. Below Yi Eun (Crown Prince) is Yi Gu."/> <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>So the first reason Yi Won has more seniority than Yi Seok and gets to be the head of the royal family is that while Yi Seok is older, Yi Won is the son of the older brother and that makes him more senior by direct line.</p>
<p>The more important reason, though, is that he was &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; under traditional family law that is no longer valid in Korea to Yi Eun&rsquo;s, that is the former Crown Prince&rsquo;s, line.
Yi Eun&rsquo;s son Yi Gu did not have sons, which broke the direct line of the Crown Prince.
In order to carry on that line, Yi Won became Yi Gu&rsquo;s adopted son.</p>

         alt="The same diagram as above, except Yi Won is moved from below Yi Gab to below Yi Gu into Yi Eun (Crown Prince)&#39;s line with a yellow horizontal arrow reading &#39;adoption.&#39;"/> <figcaption>
            <p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Yoink!</p>

</figure>

<p>The problem under modern Korean family law is that the &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; happened after Yi Gu&rsquo;s death, which makes it legally invalid.
Posthumous adoption of a male relative to carry on a broken family line, however, was fairly common in Korea prior to the 20th century.
Even if it&rsquo;s no longer legally valid, the Jeonju Yi family as a private association can decide its own rules of succession, and if they decree that Yi Won is Yi Eun&rsquo;s grandson by posthumous adoption, they&rsquo;re free to do that.
This would not be valid for the purpose of inheritance and other matters under Korean law, but for deciding who the family decides is its own head? Why not.</p>
<p>Just be glad it wasn&rsquo;t a monkey.
Or Andrew Lee.</p>

<p>On Gardening</p>
<p class="verse">
種花愁未發 花發又愁落<br />
開落摠愁人 未識種花樂<br />
<br />
I plant the seed and fear it may not bloom;<br />
The flower blossoms, O but it will fade!<br />
In bloom and fade I worry all the same;<br />
My heart does but the garden's joys evade.<br />
