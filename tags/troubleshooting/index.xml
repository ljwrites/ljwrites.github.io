      <description>Shutting down mu server turned out to be effective when mu4e wouldn&amp;rsquo;t start.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because no upgrade goes unpunished, Mu4e was refusing to start up in Emacs, throwing an &ldquo;error in process sentinel: Mu server process ended with exit 1&rdquo; error.
I couldn&rsquo;t find this exact error message online, but a look through posts about similar error messages revealed that complaints about the Mu server were often caused by the server still running.
I took the advice in <a href="https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/8">this Mu4e issue thread</a> and ran:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>pkill -2 -u $UID mu
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>&hellip;exactly like that, without replacing the <code>$UID</code> with anything.
Mu4e sprang right back up afterward, having grabbed control of the database back from the server process that had been running.</p>
<p>Still waiting wearily for more troubles to happen, but in the meantime at least I can read emails again.</p>
