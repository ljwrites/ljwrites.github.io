<div class="verse">
<br />
唧唧復唧唧，木蘭當戶織。不聞機杼聲，惟聞女嘆息。<br />
<br />
Hark to the sound of murmurs fill the room;<br />
Mulan before the door does toil at loom.<br />
The shuttle slacks; the clacking silent falls,<br />
The only sound the maid's lamenting call.<br />
<br />
問女何所思，問女何所憶。女亦無所思，女亦無所憶。<br />
<br />
You wonder where the maiden's thoughts may bend,<br />
What memory might her give such sweet torment.<br />
Yet no phantasm grips her sturdy heart,<br />
Nor does remembrance cause her aught of doubt.<br />
<br />
昨夜見軍帖，可汗大點兵，軍書十二卷，卷卷有爺名。<br />
<br />
Past eve were seen the martial rosters grand;<br />
The Khan calls forth a muster 'cross the land.<br />
The names march onward far as you can look,<br />
And Father's name is found in every book.<br />
<br />
阿爺無大兒，木蘭無長兄，願爲市鞍馬，從此替爺徵。<br />
<br />
There's no grown son to stand in Father's stead;<br />
No brother rides so she may rest her head.<br />
At market will she buy her horse and gear,<br />
And take her Father's place wherefore to serve.<br />
<br />
東市買駿馬，西市買鞍韉，南市買轡頭，北市買長鞭。<br />
<br />
Eastward she goes, the finest horse to buy;<br />
Westward she goes for saddle fit to fly.<br />
Southward she goes for bridle and a rein,<br />
Northward she goes; a riding crop is gained.<br />
<br />
旦辭爺孃去，暮宿黃河邊，不聞爺孃喚女聲，但聞黃河流水鳴濺濺。<br />
<br />
At morning blush she rides, by parents blessed;<br />
At nighttime dark by Yellow River slept.<br />
No longer does she hear her parents' call,<br />
Only the mighty water crash and fall.<br />
<br />
旦辭黃河去，暮至黑山頭，不聞爺孃喚女聲，但聞燕山胡騎鳴啾啾。<br />
<br />
She rides at dawn, the river at her back;<br />
Encamp'd by night at the feet of Mountains Black.<br />
No longer does she hear her parents' voice,<br />
Only the savage horsemen's screaming noise.<br />
<br />
萬里赴戎機，關山度若飛。朔氣傳金柝，寒光照鐵衣。將軍百戰死，壯士十年歸。<br />
<br />
Machines of war a thousand leagues do blaze,<br />
Fly past the strongholds, 'cross the mountain ways.<br />
The frigid wind resounds with striking steel;<br />
A frozen light is burnt on coats of mail.<br />
A hundred battles fought, and many fall;<br />
A decade's strife finds some still standing tall.<br />
<br />
歸來見天子，天子坐明堂。策勳十二轉，賞賜百千強。<br />
<br />
They come before the Son of Heaven high<br />
Who sits in glory on the throne of light.<br />
By all reports, courageous deeds were done;<br />
Reward is given, just and princely sums.<br />
<br />
可汗問所欲，木蘭不用尚書郎，願馳千里足，送兒還故鄉。<br />
<br />
The Khan inquires, aught else does she desire?<br />
Mulan thinks not of office nor of honor,<br />
Her only wish to ride a thousand miles<br />
Bound for the much-loved home where she would dwell.<br />
<br />
爺孃聞女來，出郭相扶將；阿姊聞妹來，當戶理紅妝；小弟聞姊來，磨刀霍霍向豬羊。<br />
<br />
Her parents head outside the city gates;<br />
Clinging to one another, they but wait.<br />
Big Sister, told Mulan will soon be there,<br />
Puts on her dress and make-up with some care.<br />
The Little Brother, welcome feast to roast,<br />
Sharpens the knives and hurries to the goats.<br />
<br />
開我東閣門，坐我西閣牀，脫我戰時袍，著我舊時裳。當窗理雲鬢，對鏡貼花黃。<br />
<br />
"Eastward I open up the bower door;<br />
Westward I sit upon my platform chair.<br />
The long, grim cloak of war do I cast off;<br />
The skirt of girlhood I put on with love.<br />
By window clear I fix my cloud-soft hair;<br />
In mirror bright affix the flowers fair."<br />
<br />
出門看火伴，火伴皆驚忙：同行十二年，不知木蘭是女郎。<br />
<br />
Outside she steps to meet her comrades' eyes,<br />
And to a man they start in their surprise.<br />
A decade on, they've been through thick and thin;<br />
In all this time they never dreamed Mulan was not a man!<br />
<br />
雄兔腳撲朔，雌兔眼迷離；雙兔傍地走，安能辨我是雄雌？<br />
<br />
"When held, a rabbit male will kick its feet,<br />
While rabbit female looks through eyes that slit.<br />
When they run close to ground and side by side<br />
Female or male am I, can you decide?"<br />
